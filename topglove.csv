Top Glove chairman alleges activist 'sabotage' amid forced labour claims

    KUALA LUMPUR (Aug 5): Top Glove Corp Bhd executive chairman Tan Sri Dr Lim Wee Chai claimed today that old issues involving forced labour allegations against the company arose lately due to the work of an activist known as Andy Hall, who intends to “sabotage” the group.

Lim said Top Glove, which is the world's largest rubber glove manufacturer by output volume, is trying to find a solution to the matter and that the company needs to explain the matter to the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP).

“He (Hall) said bad things about the company and the industry,"" Lim claimed.

""We should be able to solve the issue within this month,” Lim said during a press conference held at the Parliament building here today.

theedgemarkets.com could not immediately reach Hall for his response following Lim's claims.

Lim, who addressed reporters' questions on forced labour allegations against the company, claimed today that Top Glove had, in the past, allowed its workers to work overtime because they wanted to work longer hours.

According to Lim, who also fielded reporters' questions on allegations involving the retention of workers’ passports by the company, claimed today that its foreign workers’ passports were retained for “safekeeping"" and that Top Glove had already returned all the passports to them about a year and a half ago.

Also present at the press conference was Plantation Industries and Commodities Minister Datuk Dr Mohd Khairuddin Aman Razali.

Mohd Khairuddin said his ministry is assisting Top Glove as the company contends with allegations regarding its operations.

“All the issues surrounding the workers’ well being are being dealt with. We hope that the world listens to Top Glove’s explanation,” Mohd Khairuddin said.

Top Glove recently made news after the US placed a detention order on the group's disposable gloves and following New Zealand's largest retail grocery organisation Foodstuffs' ban on Top Glove products.  

On July 16 this year, it was reported that Top Glove confirmed the CBP had a day earlier (July 15) placed a detention order on disposable gloves manufactured by two of the rubber glove manufacturer's subsidiaries, namely Top Glove Sdn Bhd and TG Medical Sdn Bhd.

It was reported that Top Glove said in a statement to Bursa Malaysia that the company was reaching out to the CBP through the glove producer's office in the US besides the company's customers and consultants, to understand the issue better and work towards a speedy resolution to the matter within an estimated two weeks.

""There is a possibility this may be related to foreign labour issues, which we have already resolved, save for one more issue with regard to retrospective payment of recruitment fees by our workers to agents prior to January 2019, without our knowledge. However, Top Glove has already been bearing all recruitment fees since January 2019 when our zero recruitment fee policy was implemented,"" Top Glove was quoted as saying then.

Last Wednesday (July 29), it was reported that Foodstuffs said Top Glove's products will remain off its shelves until the glove maker satisfies the organisation's ethical standards in rubber glove production.

News reports, quoting Foodstuffs head of corporate affairs and corporate social responsibility Antoinette Laird, reported that Foodstuffs' supermarket chain had pulled Top Glove's disposable rubber gloves off its shelves while investigating whether they might have been made in slave-like working conditions.

At Bursa Malaysia today, Top Glove's share price closed down 42 sen or RM1.48 at RM27.94 for a market capitalisation of about RM75.64 billion.

The stock saw some 19 million shares traded.

肯纳格研究以顶级手套2019年所聘外劳推算，若全然以外劳而换之以国内待遇员工，税前盈利冲击达到28％，而税前盈利基础的股本回酬则从17％降低至12％。
分析员指出，虽然这种推算略嫌学术性，不过若能以此作为转型，而作为一项循序渐进的措施，那么该集团生产力可改进，而且也更有持续性。
人力资源部副部长阿旺哈欣上月杪指出，政府只允许建筑、种植与农业聘用外劳，其他领域要由国内工人填补。
顶级手套2013年起（政府实施最低薪金制）推展自动化，每月2工人100万个手套，依据今年809亿6000万个手套计的1.8比率，2021年料再改善至1.7比率。

分析员认为，顶级手套投资于人力丰沛的越南、尼泊尔是一个选项；至于中国薪资比大马高，看来并不可行。
肯纳格认为在该项以国内员工取代外劳措施，对全球手套一哥的顶级手套冲击不大，业务仍可持续，并从近年和最近外国就外劳政策进行评价中，采取措施进行改进。
分析员指出，倘若从这些评价或事件发展中，顶级手套改善劳力管理，改进环境、社会和公司管治，将可闻得梅花扑鼻香。该行维持“超越大市”评级，目标价32令吉不变。

Many investors do not believe it. That is why its share price is not shooting up like other smaller glove stocks such as Comfort, Supermax, CarePlus etc.
The CEO of Comfort said at its AGM that he was increasing 5-10 percent of the selling price of gloves every month. Since Top Glove is the biggest glove manufacturer in the world, it should be able to increase its selling price by at 10 percent every month. 
In the 3rd quarter ending May, its revenue Rm 1,688 million – PBT 422 million = Rm 1,266 million production cost.
Assuming 10% selling price increase its revenue for June was Rm 1,688 X 1.10 = Rm 1,857 million – production cost Rm 1,266 = PBT Rm 591 million.
Assuming 10% selling price increase its revenue for July was Rm 1,857 X 1.1 = Rm 2,043 million – production cost Rm 1,266 = PBT Rm 777 million.
Assuming 10% selling price increase its revenue for Aug will be Rm 2043 X 1.1 = Rm 2,247 million – production cost Rm 1,266 = PBT Rm 981 million.
Total PBT for 4th quarter Rm 2,349 million. Assuming 25% tax PAT Rm 1,762 million
Total issued 2.7 billion shares
EPS for the 4th quarter Rm 1,762 million divided by 2.7 billion = 65 sen
Its EPS for 3rd quarter was 13.59 sen
Profit increase by 65 sen divided by 13.59 sen = 4.78 times.    
Mr Ooi Teik Bee has kindly checked and verified my calculation. That is why I posted my previous article namely “Top Glove is very much under-priced”.
Based on my calculation for its 4th quarter, all investors should be able to foresee Top Glove’s profit for the next financial year.
Now I believe Affin Hwang Capital Research analyst Mr Ng Chi Hoong’s Rm 100 as Top Glove’s target price.

While not immediately damaging in our view, such labour policy and the recent detention order by the US CBP over labour issues highlight the urgency for glove manufacturers to address their foreign labour dependency - raising question whether a business model that is so highly dependent on cheap foreign labour can be sustainable. A complete revamp of factory labour force from cheap foreign to local wage equivalent will significantly compromise profitability but Top Glove nevertheless remains a sustainable business entity under such a condition in our view. Of course, a transition away from cheap foreign labour – if management chooses such a route - will be a gradual process and so will the financial impact. Automation and future expansions in regional countries where labour is abundant are other viable alternatives. With choices at hand, Top Glove can sustain as a global industry leader in our view. It will learn from these unsettling experiences. Labour management should improve as may other aspects of ESG management. If so, it will come out smelling of roses.
Scope of foreign workers hiring needs to be looked at beyond being strictly confined to construction, agriculture and plantation. The Ministry of Human Resource clarified via a press statement issued shortly following the news last Thursday that it would consider applications to allow employers in sectors that are in urgent need of foreign labour such as construction, agriculture and plantation. We interpret this to mean that it would not exclude applications from other sectors next year when the hiring freeze is lifted. (Due to Covid19, there is a blanket foreign hiring freeze till the year-end.) In any case, rubber products come under the purview of the Malaysian Rubber Export Promotion Council (MREPC) – a unit under the Ministry of Primary Industries often identified to oversee the plantation sector. Given that the rubber gloves industry is one of few that is thriving currently, which provides badly needed support to the Malaysian economy and stock market, it is unlikely in our view, that the government would not heed the views of the lobbyists within the FMM where rubber products manufacturers are well represented, to allow more sectors within the manufacturing industry to employ foreigners while they strategise long-term plans to reduce the dependency.
Many of the main labour issues were being addressed since beginning of last year. Top Glove had to bear the brunt of a detention order issued on 16th July by the US Custom and Border Patrol related to labour management issues that Top Glove have, allegedly, failed to comply with international labour standards – the very same issues that they were last alleged to have committed by the Guardian in a news article dated 9th December 2018. Both allegations suggested conditions at Top Glove would meet several of the International Labour Organisation’s criteria for modern slavery and forced labour, including withheld identity documents, debt bondage and excessive overtime.
Top Glove conceded that while it may have fallen short by ILO standards, it is generally compliant with local labour laws. Given the significance of Top Glove as a major manufacturer, the government has made checks on Top Glove following the incident. While the RMCO Taskforce found Top Glove failing to implement adequate social distancing practices for which a compound was issued by the Health Ministry, and a compliance notice issued by the Ministry of Housing and Local government over crowded living environment in workers quarters, the Human Resource Ministry detected no forced labour

Market Review
Malaysia: The FBM KLCI (-0.5%) managed to recoup most of its intraday losses on the back of the eleventh hour bargain hunting in selected index heavyweights. The weakness was dragged by selected banking heavyweights following the extension of loan moratorium to targeted groups, coupled with the renewed political instability. Still, the index rose +6.9% MoM; the biggest monthly gain since October 2011. Both the lower liners and broader market finished mostly lower.
Global markets: US stockmarkets advanced on last Friday as the Dow climbed 0.5% following a string of stronger-than-expected corporate earnings from technology giants such as Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Alphabet which drove the Nasdaq (+1.5%) to close marginally below its all-time high level. European stockmarkets edged lower after erasing all their intraday gains as Eurozone’s 2Q2020 GDP sank 12.1% YoY, while Asia stockmarkets ended mostly lower.
The Day Ahead
Market sentiment was grappled with renewed volatility as investors were quick to offload their holdings after the Malaysia’s political situation took another agenda with the dissolution of Sabah state assembly. We expect the volatility to remain a feature as investors will be brace by a barrage of corporate earnings releases towards the end of the month which takes into account of the full impact of Movement Control Order (MCO).
Sector focus: With the healthcare-related stocks expected remain on the front seat; we see the technology sector keep pace as Nasdaq marched towards near all-time high. The plantation sector may warrant another glance as CPO prices stabilised.
The FBM KLCI formed another hammer candle as the key index is treading around the daily EMA9 level. We continue to see the consolidation taking shape with the 1,615 as the immediate resistance, followed by 1,630. Support is pegged at 1,585, followed by 1,560. Indicators are mixed with the MACD Histogram turning red and remains below the Signal Line, but the RSI remains above 50.

Insight - Ambitious growth agenda for gloves
Monday, 03 Aug 2020
By Yap Leng Kuwn
AMIDST the heady excitement over their stock prices, glove companies are charting expansion plans in the belief that globally, the industry has long-term growth potential.
One such company is Top Glove which has been hogging the limelight as average selling prices (ASPs) of gloves keep surging.
While revisions in ASPs are made in line with market prices, its long-term plan is to expand the number of factories every year; it has a target to reach 500 factories to achieve Fortune Global 500 status by 2040.
With its investments in technology and artificial intelligence (AI), of about RM100mil per year, it may get there with less number of factories.
The retention of its gloves by the US Customs is seen as a temporary setback, and will not change its expansion plans.
With 2,000 customers across 195 countries, sales to the United States account for 24% of its glove sales as at the nine months of financial year (FY) 2020.
Overall, it aims to increase its market share for gloves worldwide from 26% to 30% by year end.
While still keen on acquisitions with good valuations; it will review future cases with greater caution, following its purchase of Aspion at a high price, for which it later claimed back some money.
Against its debt of RM2.3bil, it has a net cash position of RM284mil arising from strong profits delivered in the third quarter.
Following a rise in monthly sales orders by about 180%, the lead time for delivery has increased from 40 to at least 400 days till around September 2021.
Top Glove is also venturing into new products such as condoms, dental dams, exercise bands and recently, face masks, household products and plastic aprons.
If an effective vaccine against the coronavirus is found, urgent buying of gloves will likely reduce.
But pre-Covid 19, global demand for gloves was already growing between 8% and 10%, driven by strong fundamentals and across geographies.
“Post-Covid 19, demand for gloves is expected to grow around 12% to 15% per annum, on increased usage in the medical and non-medical sectors, ’’ said executive chairman Tan Sri Lim Wee Chai.
In the food industry, retail shops and airlines, there is a heightened awareness of safety and hygiene.
Even with a vaccine, gloves will be needed for testing and administering the vaccine.
Currently, about 20% of the world population, mainly in the United States, European Union and Japan, account for 70% of glove usage.
Usage of gloves is still relatively low in developing countries where it is experiencing rapid growth, while in developed countries, it has expanded to other sectors such as food and beverage.
The emergence of new health threats apart from Covid-19, a growing ageing population and progressively stringent health regulations in the United States and China, are some factors supporting the glove industry.Top Glove has set aside RM3bil for capital expenditure to build 450 new lines, creating new capacity of 60 billion gloves from calendar year (CY) 2020 to CY2026.
It will continue growing its nitrile glove segment in line with market demand; currently, it has 34 factories that will increase to 36 by December, with new capacity of 7.7 billion pieces, representing an increase of 9.8%, to 86.4 billion pieces annually.
By December next year, it plans to have 39 factories with new capacity of 14 billion pieces, or a 16.2% gain, to 100.4 billion pieces annually.
And by December 2022, it aims to have 41 factories with 6.2 billion pieces, at an increase of 6.2%, to 106.6 billion pieces annually.
Should demand for natural rubber gloves rise, Top Glove is able to adjust its production mix.
All new plants will be equipped with Industry 4.0 technology; with automation, the number of workers per million gloves has been reduced by 18% compared with six months ago.
It has redeployed more than 1,000 workers from Aspion since taking over factory operations, and another 1,000 workers through manpower reduction projects and automation.
It has 19,000 employees.
As Top Glove reduces its reliance on manual labour through further automation and digitalisation, “it will invest in intelligent and energetic people who can perform higher value tasks especially in research and development, engineering and information technology, ’’ said Lim.
For Top Glove to achieve the 500th place on Fortune Global 500 by 2040, it will need to grow by at least 30 times and achieve a revenue of US$35bil, from about 500 factories.
“As a Fortune Global 500 company, we must be ready to manage a huge operation, and to do things differently, ’’ said Lim.
Top Glove’s sales proceeds are denominated in US dollars while most of its costs are in ringgit; a weaker ringgit will be positive for the company but the industry norm is to share out any cost impact with its customers.
It will not allow its experience with the purchase of Aspion, deter it from pursuing mergers and acquisitions (M&As), and joint ventures with synergistic businesses; however, it is not in a hurry to conclude any M&As.Top Glove, which had bought Aspion via a combination of cash of RM1.23bil and shares, later said the amount had been overstated by RM640.5mil and claimed for RM714.9mil.
Under an amicable deal, its subsidiary Top Care received RM245mil in settlement.
Top Glove has invested in advanced technology incorporating artificial intelligence and robotic process automation; with a strong data foundation connected through the Internet of Things, it is able to progress into advanced analytics and predictive engines to further boost its capabilities.
The Exco sub-committee for Industry 4.0 has been expanded to include leaders from across the key departments.
Top Glove has implemented warehouse automation through autonomous guided vehicles; automated chemical batching systems and supervisory control and data acquisition (Scada) for automated process control.
It also has AI empowered vision systems for glove inspections and next generation glove packing machines.
In terms of business transformation, there will be tighter integration between its enterprise systems, eliminating of data silos and streamlining of access to enterprise data.
For the transition to cloud platforms, all acquired data will be aggregated into a “data lake” for advanced insights and analytics.
The company will venture into predictive technologies for factory operations, demand forecasting and supply chain integration.
Operational and market-related issues aside, Top Glove is following its long-term plan that will place it in a stronger position, capturing markets that are under-utilised in gloves.
The views expressed are the writer’s own.

topglove,"Sat, 1 Aug 2020, 9:06 AM",It is just a pause. The Covid19 tide rises and so will Topglove. - PBlue adventures | I3investor,https://klse.i3investor.com/blogs/Pblue/2020-08-01-story-h1511470242-It_is_just_a_pause_The_Covid19_tide_rises_and_so_will_Topglove.jsp,"I find it odd that we are already talking about TG having reached its max. I would understand if this was mid 2021 and some people were concerned about the vaccine trial results but had not factored the time needed to make the vaccine and to distribute it in a mass vaccination program.
We are still in 2020.

The covid19 numbers globally, the cases per day, isn't falling. It isn't even constant. It is accelerating, rising ever higher. We are breaking the previous records every few days. If we were worried that glove demand has stop increasing while valuation continued to rise, we should have had this conversation in early May. This was when TG quickly jumped from RM7 to RM10, while Covid19 cases had remained constant. I wanted to sell at that time, thinking TG had gotten ahead of itself and Dr Fauci would control the virus. But  President Trump stopped me from making that decision when he said he would reopen the states and GOP governor followed suit. I then knew that after 3 weeks the virus would start to grow again and so would glove shares.
Now the virus is raging out of control. So this pause is just that a pause like in June. It can't last because the virus won't let it. We pay a lot of attention to the US, because they are loud and are doing insane things with regards to the pandemic. But look elsewhere and the virus is already starting a second wave in countries that had it under control in April and May.
 
Look at Japan (8% of TG sales), it is now in a second wave that is nearly 2x larger than the first. The situation in India is also rapidly deteriorating. The virus there is spreading as fast as the US during the height of the US pandemic. And worse yet, the pandemic in India is not just accelerating, the rate of acceleration is increasing! In just 15 days, the number of new cases per day in India will exceed the US. The Indian population is more than 4x larger than the US, with 1.35 billion people, allowing the virus far larger room to expend.
Australia is now experiencing a bigger second wave. Then there is Brazil, Colombia, Peru, Philippines, Indonesia Ukraine, Poland, Spain; and the list of nations losing control of their Covid19 outbreaks goes on and on. The sum total of the severity of the situation is reflected by the fact that global covid19 cases per day continues to accelerate. Not stay constant, but to grow ever faster.
There is nothing wrong selling now for a profit. A profit is a profit and nobody can argue against a profit. But for me, I don't see a reason to sell any of my TG holdings. Not during this pause, not until next year, and even then might delay it to 2022. Realistically it would be a year after the vaccine is found before we have the population vaccinated. The virus will not stop just because 200 million people have been vaccinated. That is just a drop in the bucket of humanity that number some 7500 million people, with 130 million new babies born each year.
Covid19 is the driver of the glove market bull run. It is as simple as that. The virus is honest and it will try its hardest to infect as many people as possible. As the human population is naive to the virus,so natural selection and evolution have selected for a new strain of SARS-Cov2 (G strain) that spreads even better (6x more contagious) than the original (@ D strain) in Wuhan, China. And every month of delay just gives the virus more time to mutate and be selected for improved adaptation to infect humans (and cats).
The glove bull run in glove is driven not by something as fickle as a fad, or fashion or even a market tulip mania. It is driven by the laws of biology, a virus spreading into a naïve population and medical health workers who while willing to do their duty to the human race, are unwilling to die cheaply.

该集团发文告表示，自7月17日起便通过大马总部及美国的办事处，一直与美国CBP进行有建设性的接触。
“我们已经取得良好进展，并期待着在2020年8月内就补救问题达成协议，计划到时立即开始付补偿款。”
这将使该集团能够继续为客户提供手套，在这一关键时期他们的安全和生命迫在眉睫。
此外，该集团已任命了一名独立顾问来就此课题提供建议。
股价跌26仙
由于美国产品禁令悬而未决，顶级手套30日失守26令吉，闭市下跌26仙，至25令吉88仙。
美国海关及边境保卫局（CBP）两周前以涉嫌强制劳役为由，扣留了顶级手套两家子公司的进口产品。
CBP在回应《路透社》电邮中称，顶级手套提交初步请愿书后，该局已表示必须确认其他信息。目前无法提供问题解决的时限，在获得受影响产品的充分理据前，也不会修改或撤销“扣留释放令”。
除了美国，纽西兰媒体Newsroom报道，当地最大连锁超市集团Foodstuffs已以相同理由把顶级手套的商品下架。
对此，顶级手套坚称集团严格遵守劳工监管守则，强烈否认前述报道。
除了上述坏消息，政府未将制造业列为准许聘用外劳行业，以及投资者在假期前退场等利空，都拉低了顶级手套股价。

Top Glove falls as no conclusion yet on US import ban

KUALA LUMPUR (July 30): Shares of Top Glove Corp Bhd pulled back on profit-taking today, as there has yet to be any resolution in sight on the ongoing US import restriction of its products due to forced labour allegations.
This was as shares of all other glovemakers continued to rise, with several counters emerging among leading gainers across Bursa Malaysia today.
At the time of writing, Top Glove shares fell 12 sen or 0.46% to RM26.02. Its peer and fellow KLCI component Hartalega Holdings Bhd rose 4 sen or 0.19% to RM20.16.
The other big-cap glovemakers also rose, namely Supermax Corp Bhd (up 16 sen or 0.85% to RM18.84), as well as Kossan Rubber Industries Bhd (up 8 sen or 0.44% to RM18).
Supermax warrant SUPERMX-C81 led Bursa Malaysia’s top gainers with a jump of 48 sen or 8.42% to RM6.18.
Meanwhile, small-cap counters Careplus Group Bhd (up 23 sen or 6.97% to RM3.53) and Rubberex Corp Bhd (up 21 sen or 4.17% to RM5.25) were also among the top five biggest gainers across Bursa Malaysia this morning.
Top Glove and the US customs are reportedly still in talks to settle the import ban issue, which has lasted for two weeks.
Last night, the US customs reportedly said it will not modify or revoke the 'Withhold Release Order' on products by two Top Glove subsidiaries — which has lasted two weeks — until it receives proof to demonstrate the goods were not produced with forced labour.
Further, the US Customs also said it could not specify a timeline for resolving the concerns. According to reports, Top Glove has submitted the related information to the US customs, and talks are still ongoing. Banned importers have three months to submit related proof for the ban to be revoked.
This is not the only time Top Glove products have faced supply chain issues in recent months due to forced labour allegations.
Yesterday, New Zealand’s leading supermarket chain Foodstuffs reportedly said it pulled Top Glove's disposable rubber gloves off its shelves while investigating whether they might have been made in slave-like working conditions.

US: Fed leaves interest rates unchanged, remains committed to using full range of tools. In a widely expected move, the Federal Reserve announced Wednesday that interest rates will remain at near-zero levels amid the economic hardship imposed by the coronavirus pandemic. The Fed said it decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at zero to 0.25%, where it has remained since an emergency rate cut on March 15. The accompanying statement noted economic activity and employment have picked up somewhat in recent months following sharp declines but remain well below their levels at the beginning of the year. The central bank partly attributed the recent improvement in overall financial conditions to policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to US households and businesses. The Fed also reiterated that it remains committed to using its full range of tools to support the US economy in this challenging time. (RTT)
US: Pending home sales beat expectations in June. The National Association of Realtors said on Wednesday its Pending Home Sales Index, based on contracts signed last month, rose 16.6% to 116.1 last month. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast pending home contracts, which become sales after a month or two, increasing 15% in June. Pending home sales advanced 6.3% from a year ago. Reports this month showed a surge in homebuilder confidence in July, and an acceleration in home construction and sales of both new and previously owned homes in June. The housing market is being boosted by historically low mortgage rates, offsetting record unemployment triggered by the coronavirus crisis. (Reuters)
US: Goods trade deficit narrows as exports rebound. The US’ trade deficit in goods fell sharply in June amid a rebound in exports after several month of decline when the Covid-19 pandemic disrupted the flow of goods. The Commerce Department said on Wednesday the goods trade gap dropped 6.1% to USD70.6bn last month. Exports of goods accelerated 13.9% to USD102.3bn, offsetting a 4.8% increase in goods imports to USD173.2bn. (Reuters)
EU: German economy growing by 3% QoQ after pandemic slump – DIW. The German economy is likely growing by 3% in the current quarter when compared to the previous one, partly recovering from the slump caused by the coronavirus pandemic, economic institute DIW said on Wednesday. “The signs are clearly pointing to a recovery, but despite the strong growth, it will probably take two years before the historic slump in spring is made up for,” DIW said. (Reuters)
EU: Italy producer prices continue to fall in June. Italy's producer prices continued to fall in June, but the pace of decline softened, data from the statistical office Istat showed on Wednesday. The producer price index declined 4.5% YoY in June, following a 5.3% fall in May. On a monthly basis, producer prices rose 0.5% in June, after a 0.1% fall in the preceding month. In the domestic market, producer prices rose 0.7% MoM and declined by 6.1% from a year ago in June. Producer prices in the foreign market increased 0.1% monthly in June and decreased 0.7% yearly. (RTT)
UK: Mortgage approvals bounce back in June, BOE says. British mortgage lending recovered strongly from May’s record low last month and households slowed the pace at which they repaid debt, as the economy began to open up from the coronavirus lockdown in June. Mortgage approvals rose in June to 40,010 from May’s record-low reading of 9,273, BOE data showed on Wednesday, a bigger increase than the rise to 33,900 that was the average forecast in a Reuters poll of economists. Households repaid a net GBP86m of debt in June as the lockdown gave them fewer opportunities to spend, and unemployment has yet to affect many due to a government scheme that has paid the wages of more than 9m employees. This was down from GBP4.5bn in May but less than the net GBP2bn repayment economists had forecast. (Reuters)
Hong Kong: GDP continues sharp fall in 2Q. Hong Kong's economy continued to shrink at a sharp rate in the 2Q as the coronavirus pandemic hurt demand, advance estimates from the Census and Statistics Department showed on Wednesday. GDP decreased 9% YoY after a 9.1% slump in the 1Q. In the 4Q of 2019, GDP fell 3%. The economy has now shrunk for four consecutive quarters. The latest decline of GDP was mainly attributable to the continued weak performance in both domestic and external demand, the statistical office said. Compared to the previous quarter, GDP fell a seasonally adjusted 0.1% in the 2Q. (RTT)
Japan: To release several growth forecasts for fiscal 2020, 2021 due to Covid-19 – sources. Japan plans to release several scenarios for economic growth in fiscal 2020 and 2021 due to uncertainty over how long the coronavirus pandemic will last, four government sources with knowledge of the matter said on Wednesday. The government will give projections for GDP growth based on two assumptions that the pandemic would either end quickly or be prolonged, an unusual move underscoring the unpredictability policymakers face from the health crisis. GDP is expected to shrink this year under either scenario but it would be smaller than a 5% contraction. Under its most pessimistic scenario for the fiscal year through March 2022, the government expects to see nearly flat, but still positive GDP growth, one of the sources said. (Reuters)
Japan: Fitch lowers rating outlook. Fitch Ratings downgraded Japan's sovereign rating outlook citing the sharp economic contraction caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The outlook on 'A' rating was lowered to 'negative' from 'stable'. The agency observed that a downturn in consumer spending and business investment has been exacerbated by a steep decline in exports associated with weak external demand. The economy is forecast to contract 5% in 2020, before rebounding to 3.2% growth in 2021 due partly to the low base effect. However, the economy would not recover to its prepandemic level until the 4Q of 2021, Fitch said. ""The Negative Outlook indicates that the higher debt ratio and downside risks to the macroeconomic outlook will nevertheless exacerbate the challenge of placing the debt ratio on a downward path over the medium term,"" the agency added.

Comfort price chart shows that it has gone up from 80 sen to close at Rm 5.27 in the last few months.
It has gone up 6.6 times. 
Supermax price chart shows that it has gone up from Rm 1.80 to close at Rm 18.68 in the last few months.
It has gone up more than 10 times.
Top Glove price chart shows that it has gone up from Rm 6.00 to close at Rm 26.14 in the last few months.
It has gone up only 4 times.
This does not make any business sense. Top Glove being the biggest glove manufacturer in the world should be easier and faster to raise its selling price for its products. Investors must realise that any additional selling price is pure profit because it does not involve production cost.
Unfortunately, many small investors do not want to buy Top Glove because it is priced higher than Comfort and Supermax. They do not understand that Top Glove being the biggest glove producer has the power to raise the selling price of its products easily. They do not look at the profit growth prospect which is the most powerful catalyst to push up share price. 
Nevertheless, there are 8 Investment Banks recently revised their target price for Top Glove as below.
8 research houses updated their target prices for Top Glove as below. 
Affin Hwang Outperform Rm 46.40 20/7/2020
Credit Suisse Outperform Rm 37.00 15/7/2020

  Currently there are 16.929 million Covid 19 cases and 664,272 deaths in the world. These 2 figures are still spiking as shown on the charts below. As a result, the demand for medical gloves far exceeds supply and the price for glove continue to rise. All the glove manufacturers are making more and more profit which should be reflected on their share prices.
Top Glove will announce unprecedented profit soon. 
    My objective for writing this piece is to help investors to make more money. Whether you buy or not does not make any difference to the share price because the daily volume traded is several tens of million shares.

Top Glove has petitioned against import ban, U.S. Customs says
Liz Lee
KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Leading medical glove maker Top Glove Corporation (TPGC.KL) has submitted information to prove it did not use forced labour, a U.S. Customs official said on Wednesday, following an import ban on the company.
The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) placed a detention order on imports from two subsidiaries of Top Glove two weeks ago, an action taken on firms suspected of operating with forced labour.
“Top Glove submitted an initial petition to CBP. CBP responded by identifying additional information needs. Dialogue between CBP and Top Glove is ongoing,” the CBP said in an email to Reuters.
It said it could not specify a timeline for resolving the concerns and will not modify or revoke a “Withhold Release Order” until it receives proof that establishes the admissibility of the affected merchandise.
Banned importers have three months to submit proof, including a detailed statement demonstrating that the detained goods were not produced with forced labour, the CBP says.
Top Glove did not respond immediately to a request for comment on the petition.
“Extensive reporting by non-governmental organisations and the media has documented the existence of forced labour in the rubber glove industry in Malaysia,” CBP said, adding that it continues to receive and investigate allegations of forced labour in industries connected to U.S. supply chains.
The bar on Top Glove’s units did not dampen investor appetite in the company, whose share price rose to historical highs in the week after the Customs’ detention. Top Glove’s shares have climbed 456% this year, driven by demand associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.
Share prices of other major glove producers, including Hartalega Holdings, Kossan Rubber Industries and Supermax Corporation have soared 267%, 330% and 1,244% respectively year-to-date.

这就是大马交易所目前的情况，因为投资者向手套制造商投入数十亿令吉，导致其市值迅速膨胀。
截至昨日闭市，贺特佳（Hartalega Holdings Bhd）超越了大众银行（Public Bank Bhd），成为马交所第三大公司，市值达682亿1000万令吉，仅次于马银行（Malayan Banking Bhd）的880亿2000万令吉及其同行顶级手套（Top Glove Corp Bhd）的712亿2000万令吉。
简而言之，市场对银行业大亨丹斯里郑鸿标在大众银行的持股价值评估，少于丹斯
  里林伟才在顶级手套的股权以及关锦安在贺特佳的股权。
  同时，速柏玛（ Supermax Corp Bhd）跻身前20家公司之列，因其市值增至245亿4000万令吉，紧接在后的是高产柅品工业（Kossan Rubber Industries Bhd）排名第22位，市值达221亿3000万令吉。两者目前领先于兴业银行（RHB Bank Bhd）、马电讯（Telekom Malaysia Bhd）和云顶（Genting Bhd）等。
从年初至今，贺特佳与顶级手套分别飙升了263%及461%。速柏玛狂飙1267%，高产柅品工业则劲扬316%。
这4家公司昨日收于新高纪录。
除了销售和售价提高带来的预期超额利润外，关于新冠肺炎大流行的新闻在全球没有显示出放缓的真正迹象。大马昨日新增39宗新冠肺炎确诊病例也引起了关注。
这四家手套制造商的总市值为1861亿8000万令吉，而大马四大银行，包括马银行、大众银行、联昌国际集团（CIMB Group Holdings Bhd）和丰隆银行（Hong Leong Bank Bhd）的总市值为2241亿3000万令吉。
客观地说，如果手头上有700亿令吉，你可以收购顶级手套或贺特佳，或者收购两家公司——联昌国际和森那美种植（Sime Darby Plantation Bhd）。（见图表）
就速柏玛或高产柅品工业而言，它们的市值都超过了兴业银行或国油贸易（Petronas Dagangan Bhd）。
投资分析员说：“你能说什么？以前，银行在富时隆综指的权重也很高。这是周期性的。”
他补充说：“当前，我们处于新闻驱动、情绪驱动的环境中，虽然利率较低，但黄金和股票等避险天堂正在并行发展。我们处在前所未有的时代。”
惟他警告说，手套制造不是一项超高科技业务。“市场永远是对的。它将最终找到一个平衡点，所以尽情享受吧！”

Foodstuffs pulls PPE gloves over worker abuse concerns
Foodstuffs supermarket chain has pulled disposable gloves off its shelves while it investigates whether they might have been made using slave-like working conditions. This follows a US ban on imports of gloves from the world's biggest manufacturer, Top Glove.
New Zealand’s biggest supermarket chain is also checking the gloves being worn in-store by its staff, after allegations of migrant labour abuse at two Malaysian Top Glove factories.
Foodstuffs, owner of the New World, Pak’nSave and Four Square chains, is looking at whether disposable rubber gloves imported by Wellington-based importer/wholesaler supplier Protec and bought by Foodstuffs could have come from factories owned by Top Glove.
Earlier this month, the US banned imports from two Top Glove subsidiaries, because of alleged slave-like conditions for migrant workers in their factories.
Top Glove has been accused of forcing migrants (mostly women from Bangladesh, Myanmar and Nepal) to work long hours (12 hours a day, seven days a week is not unusual) for low wages, in factories with sub-optimal health and safety standards. 
Human rights advocates claim the workers live in huge, cramped hostels, and many are bonded to their employer or to recruitment agencies for months or years because of big debts they took out to get a job in the factory.
Some have their passports confiscated and wages withheld.
The issue has come to a head as the coronavirus pandemic massively increases demand for disposable gloves, potentially forcing more migrants to work longer hours.
Top Glove is reaping the benefits of Covid, with profits up 365 percent and a skyrocketing share price. 
Newsroom has seen evidence Top Glove products have come into New Zealand via medical supplies importer Protec, and Protec told us its customers included “Foodstuffs and the hospitals”.
The Ministry of Health told Newsroom it has imported only 100 gloves from Top Glove since April 1, but it isn’t clear what happened before then. The opacity of supply chains in New Zealand also means it is unclear whether private hospitals, GP surgeries, carers, and private companies like retailers and food factories could still be using Top Glove products.
Foodstuff’s head of corporate affairs and CSR [corporate social responsibility] Antoinette Laird told Newsroom gloves had been pulled from supermarket shelves and replaced for use by staff in stores.
“On investigation, one local supplier of disposable gloves has been found to import from Top Glove. Where this brand of disposable glove was stocked for retail sale in our stores, it has now been removed from the shelf. Where this brand was being used for the preparation of food in our stores, they are being replaced with an alternative brand. 
“Top Glove products will remain off our shelves until we are satisfied ethical standards have been met.” 
Laird says Foodstuffs Own Brands Ltd recently became a member of the Social and Ethical Data Exchange, “which means all international suppliers and manufacturing partners are required to be registered, providing transparency on their CSR credentials and social and ethical standards, including audit results.”"

Glovemakers raise ASP guidance as virus lingers
In its research note yesterday, UOBKH pointed out that the likes of Top Glove Corp Bhd, Kossan Rubber Industries Bhd and Hartalega Holdings Bhd (Big-3) have revised upwards their ASP guidance for the months of August and September. It noted that Top Glove, in particular, had raised its spot sales mix to 20%-30% from 10%-15% previously.
 
 
PETALING JAYA: Amid the unabated concerns over the Covid-19 outbreak, major glovemakers have revised upwards their average selling price (ASP) guidance for the next two months.

However, industry spot sales ASPs remain unchanged at two to three times contract ASPs, UOB Kay Hian Research (UOBKH) noted.

“With the higher revisions and spot sales mix, we expect 2020 industry blended ASP to increase by 69% year-on-year (y-o-y) (versus 23% y-o-y previously), ” the brokerage said.

“Order visibility as reflected by delivery lead time is further extended to 540 days (from 300 days in June). Contracted capacity for the second half of 2021 is almost secured. This suggests new orders being placed may only be received in 2022, ” it added.

In its research note yesterday, UOBKH pointed out that the likes of Top Glove Corp Bhd, Kossan Rubber Industries Bhd and Hartalega Holdings Bhd (Big-3) have revised upwards their ASP guidance for the months of August and September. It noted that Top Glove, in particular, had raised its spot sales mix to 20%-30% from 10%-15% previously.

Kossan, on the other hand, had accelerated its capacity addition for 2021 to 35.4 billion pieces per annum, up 10.4% y-o-y.

“Apart from that, Kossan and Supermax Corp Bhd appear to be on track to be included in the FBM KLCI as a component stock during the November 2020 review. The MSCI review in August is likely to see higher weightage for glove manufacturers as well, ” UOBKH said.Meanwhile, the brokerage noted that while the discovery of a preventive vaccine against Covid-19 could dent investor sentiment towards glovemakers, such a development would unlikely have an immediate impact on glove demand and subsequently the ASPs.

It added that a kneejerk selling in glove stocks could represent an opportune entry for for investors.

UOBKH has maintained an overweight stance on the glove sector, with Top Glove as its top sector pick.

“We like it for its increasing allocation to spot sales mix coupled with above-industry expansion growth. We also like Kossan as the company, a laggard, is playing catch-up with its peers in its ASP pricing, and has unveiled plans to accelerate capacity expansion, and is on track to being included in the FBM KLCI as a constituent stock, ” it explained.

It has maintained a hold call for Hartalega, with a target price of RM19.50. Its target price for Top Glove stood at RM36.90 and for Kossan it was RM19.40.“Our normalised valuations based on 2022 suggest there is support to existing valuations. Hence, the reward-to-risk trade-off still appears attractive to us at this juncture, ” UOBKH said.

Factoring in the recent ASP guidance, higher spot sales mix and accelerated capacity addition, UOBKH said it expects peak earnings to grow 850% against 2019. In addition, it noted its earnings estimated for the sector are 80% above consensus estimates, leaving ample positive surprises over the few quarters ahead.

  Raised on rubber
Sunday, 26 Jul 2020
By Wong Chun Wai
    Making Malaysia proud: All eyes are on Lim and Top Glove’s performance next – will it set a new record in the stock market? — Filepic
The gloves are off as Top Glove moves up the stock exchange, beating banks along the way. The bet is on whether it will be in the number one spot soon.
MALAYSIAN businessman Tan Sri Lim Wee Chai is certainly the man of the hour. He is going places no Malaysian tycoons have.
The boss of Top Glove Corporation Bhd, the world’s largest gloves manufacturer, has found his company placed as third largest market capitalisation listed on Bursa.
On Thursday, Top Glove was in second spot, but it slipped to third when Bursa closed on Friday, with Public Bank taking over.
Pole position is still Maybank’s, which had a market capitalisation of RM88.244bil, against Top Glove’s at RM70.466bil on Thursday. Maybank’s share price closed at RM7.85 on Friday against Top Glove’s RM25.44.
Top Glove was at No.9 on the Singapore Exchange on Thursday, outranking bigger names like Singapore Airlines and Capitaland Ltd even.
Top Glove is expected to create Malaysian history soon by announcing the biggest jump in quarterly profit for a listed company.
The surge of the company’s share price is being watched closely by many Malaysians. Likewise, Lim’s increasing wealth, which has grown by millions by the week.
The real-time world billionaire ranking now has Lim at 443 in a list of 2,095 of the world’s richest persons with a wealth of at least US$5.2bil (RM24bil) as at July 23.
The 62-year-old Universiti Malaya physics graduate and Tunku Abdul Rahman College alumnus is ranked Malaysia’s 14th richest person in this year.By now, many foreigners would have sat up and taken note of Lim and his incredible showing in the stock market due to the demand for his rubber products amid the Covid-19 scourge.
Most tycoons are either reclusive, eccentric, heavily guarded or flamboyant, but Lim checks none of the above.
Westerners and even those of us not familiar with his name, would be surprised by his modest lifestyle.
He is a strong supporter of Tzu Chi, like fellow tycoon Tan Sri Vincent Tan.
Tzu Chi, headquartered in Taiwan, is a Buddhist charitable organisation which has volunteers and supporters all over the world. Malaysia, with a million-strong following, is an integral overseas centre.
Lim has been involved in Tzu Chi’s fund-raising efforts for some years, thanks to his persuasive wife Puan Sri Tong Siew Bee, a full time and long-time Tzu Chi volunteer.
Sharing his experience of serving Tzu Chi, Lim said he could only raise RM36 on his first outing after walking the streets for two hours.
“Nobody knew me and few donated. But that frustration did not dampen my enthusiasm to carry out good and meaningful work, ” he said in an interview with The Star.
Despite having to manage a huge corporation for six-and-a-half days a week, Lim persisted in availing himself to attend Tzu Chi’s volunteer course to be a “qualified and certified” volunteer.
Those unfamiliar with the Tzu Chi way would be stunned if they saw a tycoon like Lim seeking donations in public places, where volunteers need to bow and thank donors and the people they help.
Tzu Chi volunteers consider it an honour and privilege to engage in charitable work. The organisation has even helped rebuild mosques and churches in areas affected by disasters.
Lim’s most distinctive feature is his constant reminder to his listeners – especially those meeting him for the first time and sharing a moment – to take care of their body to remain healthy.
It hasn’t been easy for me being a Penangite with a love for food that includes greasy carb favourites, of which Lim would surely disapprove.
Last week, he texted this writer to reveal that he has been a complete vegetarian for the past two years, adding that his wife and son are also vegetarians.
Rule number one – stay fit and healthy! That was his opening line at a talk given to entrepreneurs. It’s an important criterion for those wishing to achieve great goals in life.
“When you are sick, you don’t earn anything, and you continue to have to spend money on fixed expenses on top of medical costs. But when you’re healthy, you can add value every day, ” he said.
He also has a peculiar induction for all new employees – everyone receives a toothbrush, toothpaste, tongue cleaner and dental floss, and all staff are required to brush their teeth three times a day.
In an interview, Lim set a goal of staying healthy and living until 120 years old.
He reportedly told The Health digital magazine that placing a priority on mental and physical well-being has helped him build his wealth.
Lim has practised what he calls his “5 Quality Wells” since young – clean well, eat well, work well, exercise well and sleep well – which he believes to be the formula for a long, healthy and prosperous life.
The company also monitors the body mass index (BMI) of its staff and has a policy of not hiring smokers. It also has full time nutritionists to design the company’s cafeteria menu and advise its workers on suitable diets.
Lim exercises four days a week, which comprises two days of badminton and two more of evening golf, and on occasion, he plays table tennis, too.
Top Glove employees are also required to sign a pledge every year to vouch that they will not condone or be involved in corrupt practices, with all new staff required to attend compulsory training specifically focused on combating corruption.
It has been a tremendous journey for Lim and his wife, who started their company in 1991 with their entire savings of just RM180,000.
Failure was not an option, he said, since they had no backup plan.
Fortunately, with his parents owning a small rubber plantation, he was exposed to the rubber trade from early on, while growing up in the small town of Titi in Negri Sembilan.
It’s interesting how other tycoons also ventured into the rubber gloves business but gave up because of the small profit margin then.
However, Lim persevered, and today Top Glove controls 26% of the world’s rubber glove market with 43 factories worldwide and with an annual production capacity of over 70.5 billion gloves.
Lim is certainly a good entrepreneur to emulate. A couple of years ago, I invited him to share his thoughts and experiences with readers of The Star.On the eve of the talk, I decided to turn up at the venue to make sure the sound system and seating arrangements were in order, and I was surprised to see Lim rehearsing his lines on stage – 24 hours before the event.
This is a man who takes his work seriously and is driven by a goal. Yet, he remains down to earth with almost no extravagance one can think of.
Almost everyone, especially in Kuala Lumpur, Singapore and Hong Kong, is holding their breath to see how Top Glove performs next and if its shares will surpass the RM30 mark and set a new record for being on top.
This isn’t exactly a rags-to-riches tale, but certainly a fantastic story of a small-town man becoming one of the richest people in the world dealing with a commodity Malaysia knows best – rubber.

Market Review
Malaysia: The FBM KLCI (+1.2%) recovered all its previous session losses as the resumption of upward momentum in glove heavyweights powered the key index beyond the 1,600 psychological level. The lower liners extended their gains, while the broader market finished mostly higher with the exception of healthcare (-1.8%) and transportation & logistics (-0.5%) sectors.
Global markets: US stockmarkets retreated as the Dow (-1.3%) wiped out all its previous session gains after the Labour Department reported number of unemployment filings rose for the first time in 16 weeks to 1.4m vs. 1.3m in the previous week. European stockmarkets closed mildly lower after erasing all their intraday gains, while Asia equities closed mixed.
The Day Ahead
The upbeat momentum on the FBM KLCI continues to be induced by the strong performance on glovemakers heavyweights. Gains, however, may be limited owing to the weakness on Wall Street overnight which may permeates to the Asia equities. Amid the rising number of Covid-19 cases, the buying momentum in glove makers stocks may provide some cushion to further weakness.
Sector focus: With CPO prices rallying above RM2,700 per metric tonne we reckon that plantation stocks will be trading in a positive manner. At the same time, we remain upbeat on the construction sector that emerged as biggest broader market winner (+2.0%) yesterday as a proxy to economic revival play for 2H2020.
The FBM KLCI has formed a bullish candle to remain above the daily EMA9 level as momentum was upbeat throughout the trading session. Despite that, the FBM KLCI remained within a range bound mode with immediate resistance located at 1,615, followed by 1,630. Supports are pegged at 1,560, followed by 1,530. Indicators have turned slightly positive with the MACD Histogram turning green but remains mildly below the Signal Line, while the RSI remains above 50.

We maintain our HOLD call on FBM KLCI ETF but raise our fair value (FV) by 7% to RM1.76 (from RM1.64) (Exhibit 1). Our FV is based on our FVs (for stocks under our coverage), consensus FVs (for stocks not under our coverage) and last traded price (for Hap Seng Consolidated, which is not under any coverage). It is at a slight premium to its NAV of RM1.67 (Exhibit 1).
The FV upgrade is driven largely by upgrades in our FVs for glove makers Top Glove (+28% to RM25.69) and Hartalega (+31% to RM16.23), on the back of upward earnings revisions on higher glove selling price assumptions and for longer as the Covid-19 pandemic rages on with a number of countries reporting record daily new cases.
Post-pandemic, we believe the outlook for the glove sector will remain favourable given the higher hygiene standards and practices of global population. However, as in the past pandemics, we are mindful of an expected temporary slump in sales as end users run down their stock holding.
We are mildly positive on the outlook for the FBM KLCI. We have an end-2020 target of 1,530 pts for the benchmark index based on 18x our projected 2021F earnings, which is consistent with its 5-year historical average.
We believe there is a case for the FBM KLCI’s multiple to stay elevated to reflect the robust domestic liquidity driven by the risk-on sentiment globally triggered by the massive monetary and fiscal stimulus packages put in place by central banks and governments around the globe, optimism on economy reopening and the news flow on vaccine development. Also helping, is the reality that riskfree assets, i.e. cash and Malaysian Government Securities, are hardly generating any positive inflationadjusted yield.

Since many investors have followed me to buy Top Glove, some of them are worried by the daily price fluctuation. The price chart below shows that the price has been fluctuating a few sen up and down in the last few days. It is not plunging down.
8 research houses updated their target prices for Top Glove as below.

Affin Hwang Capital noted in a report recently, Top Glove share price could hit as high as Rm 110 on value in a bull case scenario if selling prices increase by 10% month to month each month in financial year 2021.  
All investors should not worry by the daily price fluctuation because the 8 Investment Banks have just raised their target price for Top Glove which should be achievable sooner or later.
Statistics shows that long term investors can make more money if they buy and wait patiently. Short term day traders cannot make much money due to transaction cost. I can see a few people on the Top Glove forum boasting that they sold and hope to buy back at cheaper prices. They will be disappointed.
You may like to know more about Top Glove: 
Top Glove is one of the top 3 largest Malaysian rubber glove manufacturers. The company owns and operates 45 manufacturing facilities in Malaysia, Thailand, and China. It also has marketing offices in these countries as well as the United States, Germany, and Brazil.
  Currently there are 15,031,133 Covid 19 cases and 620,805 deaths in the world. These 2 figures are still spiking up.
Due to Covid 19 pandemic the demand for medical gloves far exceeds supply and Top Glove can easily increase its selling price. Additional selling price is pure profit because it does not involve production cost. As a result, the company will continue to report increasing profit in the next few quarters until Covid 19 pandemic is under control.  Although vaccine is at its final stage of testing, many scientists predicted the pandemic will not be under control for at least 1 or more years as the number of new Covid 19 cases is still spiking as shown by the above chart.

Market Review
Malaysia: The FBM KLCI (+0.4%) recovered most of its previous session losses, boosted by gains in selected banking heavyweights as the key index hovers mostly in the positive territory yesterday. The lower liners also rebounded amid the positive market undertone, while the broader market ended mostly higher.
Global markets: US stockmarkets managed to hold onto their gains as the Dow and S&P 500 climbed 0.6% and 0.2% each, but the Nasdaq fell 1.1% after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell does not expect another stimulus bill to pass in the next two weeks. European stockmarkets ended higher after EU leaders agreed €2.1tn rescue package spur economic growth, while Asia stockmarkets closed higher yesterday.
The Day Ahead
Financial institutions in Malaysia have declared that extension of loan moratorium is off the table, with options for repayment to targeted groups; suggests that the potential spike in non-performing-loans in the final quarter of the year will be contained and the nation is on track for recovery. Further stimulus from central banks across (EU and Japan) and positive developments vaccine for Covid-19 may further contribute to the positive sentiment.
Sector focus: Long-term investors could also capitalise on the recovery in financial sector as financial institutions perceived that the impact from the end of loan moratorium is not as negative as expected, while energy stocks will also be favourable after crude oil prices jumped to the highest level since March 2020.
The FBM KLCI eked out some gains as the key index continues to be supported above the daily EMA9 level. The recovery may see gains to build-up over the near as the key index looks to re-test the immediate resistance at around 1,615, followed by 1,620. The support is pegged at 1,560, followed by 1,530. Indicators remain slightly positive as the MACD Line is still above the Signal Line, while the RSI remains above 50.

Global: Asian markets ended higher, taking cues from a technology-fueled rally amid overnight fresh record high on Nasdaq and a slew of positive news on the coronavirus vaccine front coupled with a pivotal EUR750bn European Union’s stimulus plan to revive the coronavirus-hit economies.
Tracking higher European markets following the approval of an E$750bn Covid-19 rescue funds, the Dow surged as much as 345 pts to 27025 amid optimism around a potential vaccine and further economic stimulus amounting to USD1.0-1.5 trillion. However, profit taking pared the gains to 159 pts at 26840 as investors shifted to the cyclical sectors and booked profits in growth/momentum stocks coupled with potential disappointment that the stimulus bill would be rolled out by end July when the US$600/week federal unemployment insurance benefit is set to expire.
Malaysia. Tracking higher regional markets and active buying interests in banking and glove stocks, KLCI rose 6.5 pts after gyrated within 14 pts between an intra-day high of 1601.8 and a low of 1587.9. Trading volume decreased to 9.34bn shares valued at RM5.39bn as compared to Monday’s 12.5bn shares worth RM6.64bn. Market breadth was positive with 634 gainers as compared to 428 losers.
TECHNICAL OUTLOOK: KLCI
After hitting a low of 1476 (29 June), KLCI staged a 141-pt relief rally to a 6M high at 1617 (14 July) before retreating lower again to 1596 (+32% from Covid-19 bottom of 1208) yesterday. Overall, current consolidation mode would prevail and is healthy to neutralize overbought technical momentum for a more sustained uptrend going forward. Key resistances are near 1600 and 1617 and a decisive close above the 1617 would open the door for higher targets at 1635 (upper BB) and 1679 (200W SMA) zones. Key support falls at 1563 (17 July low) and breaking below this level would trigger more selldown towards 1545 (30D SMA) and 1525 (50W SMA) territory.
MARKET OUTLOOK
We are mindful of downside risks to domestic economy and corporate earnings amid soaring fears of 2nd wave infections (could worsen if a vaccine is not found before the winter), domestic banking sector asset quality, fiscal spending and debt constraints, re escalation of US China tension, coupled with lingering political uncertainty. Moreover, with Top Glove and Hartalega collectively contributing about 12% of the FBMKLCI’s market capitalisation as at yesterday, volatility in their share prices will continue to influence KLCI short term performance. Overall, current market consolidation mode would prevail and is healthy to neutralize overbought technical momentum for a more sustained uptrend going forward. Key resistances are near 1600, 1617 and 1635 (upper BB) whilst supports fall at 1563 (17 July low), 1545 (30D SMA) and 1525 (50W SMA) levels.
On a seprate note, our sector analyst viewed the breach of SOP during MCO will minimally affect Top Glove (penalty c. RM1k) and supported by an recent achievement of “A” rating during a social audit by Amfori (leading global business association for open and sustainable trade). Hence, any pullback in Top Glove (HLIB Research-Buy-TP RM31.31) share price is a good opportunity to accumulate. Key resistances are RM28.00-RM29.30- RM30.30 whilst supports fall on RM22.60-RM21.60-19.60. Cut loss at RM19.20.

In a statement today, the ministry said this was determined through investigations conducted by a combined task force from the Anti-Trafficking in Persons and Anti-Smuggling of Migrants Act 2007 and movement control order (MCO) in which the company was found to have breached standard operating procedures (SOPs) under the MCO, but that no violations of forced labour were found.
“The investigation was conducted at Top Glove headquarters in Meru, Klang on July 13. The company was found flouting the rules under the recovery MCO, such as no social distancing between workers at the workplace and crowded accommodation for workers.
“The company has since been issued a compound by the Health Ministry and compliance notice by the Ministry of Housing and Local Government,” the statement read.
Human Resources Minister Datuk Seri M. Saravanan has also met Top Glove Corp Bhd and the Malaysian Rubber Glove Manufacturers Association to understand further why two Top Glove subsidiaries, Top Glove Sdn Bhd and TG Medical Sdn Bhd, were issued with the detention order was issued by the United States Customs and Border Protection (USCBP), and subsequently placed on its Withhold Release Order (WRO) list last Thursday.
“The government is committed and will not compromise when it comes to addressing the issue of forced labour in the country.
“(And) since the element of forced labour is also closely related to the issue of accommodation for foreign workers, the ministry has taken into account the enforcement of Minimum Standards Act Employee Housing, Accommodation and Facilities or Act 446 (Amendment) 2019 by the Human Resources Ministry committee which will commence on September 1 this year,” the statement added.
According to the statement, the enforcement of this Act is in line with international standards recommended by Labour Organisation International (ILO).
“The ministry does not want local employers including those in the rubber industry to commit actions that are against Act 446 where employers will be convicted over violations in relation to forced labour,” the statement said.
The Human Resources Ministry also instructed all employers to implement Independent Social Compliance Audit (ISCA) to ensure compliance with the national standards.
The implementation of the ISCA was decided during the Joint Committee Meeting between the home minister and human resources minister last year who agreed on an implementation date of January 1, 2021.
Top Glove has since defended its stand and said the detention order was likely imposed due to the reimbursement needed to be given to workers who previously paid recruitment agent fees to get a job at the glove manufacturing company.

Top Glove HQ raided but cleared of forced labour
By FocusM |  28 minutes ago |  Mainstream
TOP Glove Corp Bhd's headquarters in Meru, Klang, had been raided by enforcers on July 13 but the world's largest glove manufacturer was cleared of forced labour, the Human Resources Ministry (MOHR) said.
Enforcers found Top Glove had breached movement control order rules as well as provided cramped quarters for foreign staff, the ministry said in a statement today.
The operation was conducted by task forces for the Anti-Trafficking in Persons and Anti-Smuggling of Migrants Act 2007 and the recovery MCO.
“This led to Top Glove being fined by the Ministry of Health, and issued a notice of compliance by the Ministry of Housing and Local Government. However, nothing was found to indicate there were elements of forced labour,” MOHR said.
Also, the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) detention order on Top Glove, which came into effect on July 15, was due to the possibility of forced labour, and that this had happened before to WRP Asia Pacific Sdn Bhd in 2019, the ministry added.
“The ministry is aware of how the CBP detention order can affect the credibility and image of Malaysia, while influencing foreign investor confidence following the allegations of forced labour,” MOHR said.
The detention order saw Human Resources Minister M Saravanan meeting with Top Glove, as well as other rubber industry players under the Malaysian Rubber Glove Manufacturers Association to seek clarification on the matter.

Tuduhan terhadap Top Glove tidak berasas - Saravanan
Ridauddin Daud, Astro Awani | Julai 21, 2020 18:09 +08 | Durasi: 1 minit, 34 saat
  Saravanan berkata, agensi luar negara tidak sepatutnya mengambil tindakan berdasarkan maklumat tidak sahih.
PUTRAJAYA: Kebanyakan tuduhan terhadap Top Glove Corporation Bhd (Top Glove) termasuk dakwaan terbabit dalam penggunaan buruh paksa adalah tidak berasas, kata Menteri Sumber Manusia, Datuk Seri M Saravanan.

Beliau berkata maklumat itu diperoleh hasil siasatan Jabatan Tenaga Kerja susulan tindakan Amerika Syarikat (AS) menyekat masuk produk keluaran syarikat tersebut.
  Tegasnya, agensi luar negara tidak sepatutnya mengambil tindakan berdasarkan maklumat tidak sahih, sebaliknya perlu berhubung dengan kementerian berkenaan untuk penjelasan terlebih dahulu.

“Saya telah mengarahkan Jabatan Tenaga Kerja untuk menyiasat dan didapati kebanyakan tuduhan itu adalah tidak berasas. Ada sedikit sebanyak kekurangan tapi itu semua dapat diatasi.
  “Tetapi bukan seperti mana dituduh agensi luar negara. Saya akan melawat Top Glove bersama pegawai-pegawai kanan daripada kementerian.

“Kami juga akan menjemput wakil dari AS supaya sama-sama melihat dan membuktikan tuduhan ini tidak berasas,” katanya dalam sidang media selepas bertemu pemain industri di sini pada Selasa.

Top Glove sebelum ini berkata, Jabatan Kastam dan Perlindungan Sempadan Amerika Syarikat (CBPAS) telah mengeluarkan arahan sekatan terhadap produk sarung tangan pakai buang yang dikeluarkan dua anak syarikatnya, Top Glove Sdn Bhd dan TG Medical Sdn Bhd.

Syarikat pengeluar sarung tangan terbesar dunia itu akan meminta penjelasan daripada CBPAS dan menyelesaikan isu tersebut dengan segera.

Dalam pada itu, Saravanan berkata hampir 25,000 peluang pekerjaan untuk warga tempatan bakal disediakan dalam industri pembuatan sarung tangan.

“Kita telah berbincang dengan hampir 40 syarikat pengeluar sarung tangan. Keperluan semasa mereka adalah lebih kurang 20,000 ke 25,000 pekerja.

“Saya telah arahkan mereka supaya beri keutamaan kepada warga tempatan dan mereka bersetuju.

“Hari ini 40 syarikat pengeluar ini telah setuju untuk ambil pekerja tempatan dan mereka perlu buat iklan dalam portal kerja yang ada di bawah Kementerian Sumber Manusia utk menunjukkan keikhlasan,” ujarnya.

Top Glove Corporation Berhad 旗下2家子公司 就是 Top Glove Sdn Bhd 和 TG Medical Sdn Bhd 在美国的总销售额有12.5% 被美国海关和边境保护局（CBP）被扣留了。最关键的是美国是一个主要的市场，占Top Glove 的总销售量的25%。
当Top Glove 的货物被美国海关扣留的消息传出后，公司高管就举行了Analyst-cum media briefing 的检讨会。Top Glove 预计两家自公司的货物将在美国的海关被扣留大概两个星期到四个星期。
据说除了一个关于Top Glove 的工人在2019年1 月之前向代理商追付的招聘费问题外，这有可能是和他们已经解决的外国劳工有关问题有关，公司已经解决了这个问题。 Analyst Briefing 也提到自从2019年1月实行的零招聘费用问题以外，这有可能是公司已经解决的外国劳工问题有关，而他们也解决了这个问题。
根据报导，一名出席简报会的Analyst称，如果一旦问题被解决，被扣留的货物就可以被释放。 Top Glove 对这些表示不担心，因为他们可以通过运往去其他国家，比如 Latin America因为需求也很强。Top Glove 也透入，他们的Average Selling Price (ASP)在其他国家会更加的低，与正常的订单相差5%，但现货订单的价格是一样的。
 2020年7月16日，因为货物被美国海关扣留，马来西亚证券交易所 (BursaMalaysia) 的交易停止了，但Top Glove 在新加坡的证券交易所被heavy sell down。Top Glove 是当地交易所跌幅最大的股票。 当天下午3点30分恢复交易时，公司的股价下跌RM2.10，跌幅9.63%,至 RM19.70. 成交量为2.64million 股，明显高过200天平均成交量的339,000股。据Bursa 所说，它目前在面临着技术问题。
在2020年7月20日，Topglov建议会给1送2 的Bonus Issue，派送最多54亿8000万的红股。 而且红股割名日期有待确定和宣布。这个红股发行计划会增强该股票的流动性，奖励股东及扩大股东的持股量，以回馈他们的忠诚和持续支持。

This development did not come as a surprise, considering that Top Glove’s share price has surged significantly in the recent months and this is seen as a form of reward to its existing shareholders. Upon the completion of the said bonus issue, Top Glove’s enlarged share capital should reach 8.22bn shares. The issuance is expected to complete in 3QCY20. On a separate note, the US Customs and Border Protection (US CBP) has requested Top Glove to conduct an audit before lifting the ban. We think that Top Glove will likely pass the audit, considering that the Group has successfully completed close to 80 audits in CY19. With that being said, we lift our PE multiple to 33x (at +1SD of its 5- year historical mean), subsequently raising our TP to RM26.70, maintain Trading Buy.
Details. As at 6th July 2020, Top Glove’s issued share capital stood at RM1.59bn, comprising of 2.69bn shares. Separately, there are 23.5m outstanding ESOS options and exchangeable bonds that will result in 20.2m new shares issuance upon full conversion. The enlarged share base should reach 8.22bn shares when the issuance is completed. Top Glove expects the bonus issue to complete in 3QCY20, while entitlement date has yet to be determined.
Rationale for the issuance. The proposed bonus issue is a form of reward to the Group’s existing shareholders. It would also improve trading liquidity as well as encourage investors’ participation, given a larger share base and lower share price post-bonus issue.
No direct changes to fundamentals. The corporate exercise is not expected to result in any fundamental change, apart from the larger share base, as no cash will be raised via this issuance and no shareholdings dilution is expected to occur. Should the proposed bonus issue goes through, our CY21F’s EPS will be diluted to 28.2sen per share and our TP will be subsequently adjusted to RM8.80.
Updates on the detention order. Following the detention order imposed onto Top Glove last week, the Group has since managed to be in contact with the US CBP. US CBP has requested for an audit to be conducted and be presented to the US CBP prior to the lifting of the ban. An independent consultant has been appointed by Top Glove to carry out the audit and we think it is likely that Top Glove would be able to pass the audit considering that they have successfully completed c.80 audits in CY19

The entitlement date will be determined and announced later. The proposed bonus issue is expected to be completed by third quarter of CY2020.
We are positive on the bonus issue. We view the bonus issue positively as it would improve trading liquidity of the Top Glove shares. Under maximum scenario, the enlarged issued share capital after the proposed bonus issue will increase to 8.2bil shares from 2.7bil shares. The bonus issue also allows Top Glove to reward its existing shareholders.
Enhance affordability of shares. The bonus issue is expected to enhance affordability of Top Glove shares. We estimate that theoretical ex-bonus issue price, assuming yesterday’s closing price, to be at RM8.15, making the stocks more affordable to retail investors. Hence, we think that the bonus issue will make Top Glove shares more attractive to investors.
Positive earnings outlook intact. We continue to expect positive earnings outlook for Top Glove despite the recent news on the detention order from US as Top Glove is confident to resolve the issue within 2 weeks. Earnings of Top Glove is expected to underpin by the higher average selling price (ASP) of gloves as demand for gloves remains strong amid Covid-19 pandemic.
Maintain BUY with a revised TP of RM27.94. We make no changes to our earnings forecast for FY20/21/22F as the bonus issue is not expected to have effect on earnings of Top Glove. Nevertheless, we revise our TP for Top Glove to RM27.94 from RM26.12 as we peg FY21F EPS of 60.8sen at a higher PER of 46x (previously 43x) in view of the improved trading liquidity. We value Top Glove slightly above its upcycle PER of +1SD 3-year mean PER due to the resilient demand for gloves and enhanced trading liquidity. Hence, we maintain our BUY call on Top Glove.

Market Review
Malaysia: After enduring a choppy trading session, the FBM KLCI (-0.4%) retreated as gains on glove heavyweights were weighed down by weakness selected banking and telco heavyweights amid the concern over rising cases of Covid-19. The lower liners also retreated despite trading volumes surged to fresh record high with 12.5bn shares exchanging hands, while the broader market finished mixed.
Global markets: US stockmarkets recovered from their intraday losses as the Dow gained 0.03% on expectations over additional stimulus measures, coupled with the strong gains in technology stocks that propel the Nasdaq (+2.5%) to close at fresh all-time high. European stockmarkets finished mostly higher, while Asia stockmarkets ended on a mixed note yesterday.
The Day Ahead
After a pullback yesterday, we think that mild bargain hunting activities will take charge as investors’ risk appetite remains well within the equities market. This is demonstrated by the rising trading activities as of late which may see rotational play to stay firm over the foreseeable future. In the meantime, expectations over further stimulus measures to combat the economic slowdown due to the rising number of Covid-19 cases may provide further boost the recovery.
Sector focus: We see plantation stocks to perform positively amid the rising CPO prices that hit five-months high that is spurred by lower inventory level and improving demand prospects. At the same time, the record closing in Nasdaq may also provide some legs to the technology sector to march higher.
The FBM KLCI managed to trim its losses after coming off from intraday low as the key index remain above the daily EMA9 level. The intraday recovery suggests that quick bargain hunting activities may see the key index to re-test resistance at around 1,615, followed by 1,620 over the near term. In contrast, the support is pegged at 1,560, followed by 1,530. Indicators are still slightly positive as the MACD Line is still above the Signal Line, while the RSI remains above 50.

We believe that the recent resurgence of COVID-19 will drive ASPs higher in coming months, as the current shortage looks likely to worsen
Our bull-case scenario indicates that TOPG’s fair value could be as high RM110.20, if selling prices do increase by 10% mom each month in FY21E
Selling Prices Continue to Surprise on the Upside
We hosted a conference call with management recently, which was well attended by >60 local and foreign investors. During the call, management raised their guidance on ASP growth for August to +25% mom from +15% mom. This came as a positive surprise to us, as we did not expect ASPs to increase by more than >15% mom for 3 consecutive months. We believe that ASPs can continue to increase by at least 5% mom each month moving into FY21E (as per management guidance) given the recent resurgence of COVID-19 in developed countries, which will drive demand and hence ASPs.
What If Selling Price Increase by More Than 5% Mom?
We believe there is a likelihood that ASPs could increase beyond the 5% mom increase given the current resurgence of COVID-19. Based on our estimates, if ASPs were to increase by 8-10% mom each month, our earnings estimates for FY21E will increase by a further 24%-42%. Based on a PE multiple of 30x, the fair value of TOPG shares would be around RM56.20-RM63.60. However, if we were to base it on 52x (similar to Hatalega’s [HART MK, MK17.46, Buy] valuation), the fair value of TOPG could surpass RM110, which implies an upside of more than 344% from the current level.
Reiterate BUY With a Higher TP of RM46.40
We are raising our earnings forecasts for FY20E-22E by 35%-310%, imputing a higher ASP assumption. We are also raising our TP to RM46.40, though based on a lower CY21E PER of 30x which is based on its 3-year historical mean, and we maintain our BUY call. We are not overly concerned by the detention order issued by the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and expect it to be resolved within the next 2-4 weeks. We estimate the impact on earnings for FY20E is around 5-6%. However, if the issue prolongs, TOPG will have to re-ship it goods to other countries, though it could benefit from higher spot prices. Key risks to our call include: 1) intensifying competition from other countries; 2) higher volatility in rawmaterial prices; and 3) worsening labor issues

  今天相信是大部分散户都是非常开心的一天  除了这两家公司宣布做 Bonus Issue 之外，BURSA（1818）也是赚到笑，交易量突破新高达到 12.5 Billion，而它本身的股价今天也一度超过 RM 10 以上！
*幸好这次没有被交易量压垮当机，呵呵 
  那回到我们的主题，TOPGLOV 今天宣布了 2:1 的 Bonus Issue，简单的说就是你每持有 1 股 TOPGLOV 公司就会送你 2 股，而 SUPERMX 则是宣布了 1:1 的 Bonus Issue，那这里小编相信大家都知道 1:1 的意思了，如果知道的读者可以在下面留言哦！
  假设说，你现在持有 5,000 股 TOPGLOV 的话，那么在 Bonus Issue 过后你就会获得额外的 10,000 股，总数来说是 15,000 股 TOPGLOV 在手：
   5,000 股 TOPGLOV（原本买入的）+ 10,000 股 TOPGLOV（Bonus Issue 送的）= 15,000 股 TOPGLOV
问题来了，很多新手看到 “送” 股  那么是不是代表着现在 TOPGLOV 股价是 RM 24.820，我在 Bonus Issue 过后就会有 15,000股 x RM 24.820 = RM 372,300 呢（3倍）呢？
  NO  ！股价在 Bonus Issue 过后一定会调整！一个简单的方程式就是 RM 24.820 / (1 Normal Share + 2 Bonus Issue Shares) = RM 8.27333  这只是例子而已，Bonus Issue 调整后的价格会因价格变动而变得不一样~
  那么 Warrant 的话现在又怎么算呢？先说明一下，今天小编跟大家讨论的是 “Structured Warrant“，而不是 ”Company Warrant“  简单地说我们今天讨论的 Warrant 是不可以转换成母股，只是可以在结算日当天跟发行者（投资银行）结算的..
  现在我们就从 Macquarie Warrant 里面的 TOPGLOV-C79 为例子  TOPGLOV-C79 目前的 Exercise Value 为 RM 26.000，如果在 TOPGLOV 发行 2:1 的 Bonus Issue 过后，他的 Exercise Price 就会 / (1 Normal Share + 2 Bonus Issue Shares) = RM 8.66667*
  *这个变化只有在 TOPGLOV 所进行的 Bonus Issue 的 Ex-Date 过后才会出现  而 Ex-Date 可以简单理解为 “已经关闭登录可以获得 Bonus Issue 的股东“ 的日子，比如说 08/08/2020 是 Ex-Date，那么在 07/08/2020 或者更早之前买入的都可以获得 Bonus Issue，而 Exercise Price 也会在 08/08/2020 跟着母股一起调整~
  我们再以 SUPERMX-C99 为例子；SUPERMX-C99 的 Exercise Price 是 RM 12.880  那么在调整过后就会变成 RM 12.880 / (1 Normal Share + 1 Bonus Issue Share) = RM 6.440 啦，同样的，他们会在 Ex-Date 才出现调整！
  那么又一个问题来了，Structured Warrant 的价格会出现变化吗？答案是不会的  比如说现在 SUPERMX-C99 的股价是 RM 1.320，它是不会因为 Bonus Issue 而变成 RM 0.660 的，其他 Warrant 也是一样！
  总的来说，手套股会进行 Bonus Issue 其实是预料中的事情  如果观察过去手套股的走势就会发现到了~
剩下的 HARTA（5168）以及 KOSSAN（7153）不知道会在几时公布呢？
P/S：HARTA 公布的可能非常大，而 KOSSAN 的就不一定了，大家要观察一下哦

topglove,"Tue, 21 Jul 2020, 9:34 AM",Malaysia Rubber Gloves – Is a Windfall Tax Possible? - KL Trader Investment Research Articles | I3investor,https://klse.i3investor.com/blogs/kltrader/2020-07-21-story-h1510638764-Malaysia_Rubber_Gloves_ndash_Is_a_Windfall_Tax_Possible.jsp,"Macquarie Equities Research (MQ Research) wrote a report following investors’ queries whether the government may impose a windfall tax on the glove sector. While MQ Research believes a windfall tax is possible, it would unlikely be of considerable size and would unlikely change MQ Research’s positive view on the sector. MQ Research also shared its valuations on the earnings, among others, based on an estimated tax of 10% while discussing about the proposed bonus issue by Top Glove and Supermax.
Event
MQ Research has been asked by investors, “Could the government impose a windfall tax on the glove sector?” While MQ Research believes the government could, MQ Research also believes that if it does the tax would unlikely be of a magnitude that would cause MQ Research to change its positive view on the sector. MQ Research believes a tax rate up to 10% would still leave MQ Research’s forecasts substantially ahead of consensus estimates. MQ Research sees elevated average selling price (ASP) on the back of an acute shortage in the market continuing to buoy sector earnings and valuations. MQ Research is maintaining its positive view on the sector, with Top Glove as its top pick.
Impact
Windfall tax possible, but unlikely to be substantial. In MQ Research’s view, a windfall tax of 10% would be palatable to the sector and market. MQ Research estimates a 10% windfall tax on earnings would raise RM790m from the top-four listed companies, which the government could use to cushion the 6% fiscal deficit the government is estimating for 2020. The government imposed a one-off windfall tax of 30% on the return on assets above 9% for independent power producer (IPP) in 2008 and historically has imposed a windfall levy of 1.5–3% on the plantation sector when crude palm oil (CPO) prices came in above RM2,500/tonne and RM3,000/tonne for Peninsular Malaysia and East Malaysia, respectively.
That aside, the Malaysian Rubber Glove Association (MARGMA) believes the chance that the government will impose a windfall tax is low given that the industry consistently reinvests earnings for capacity expansions and to create jobs for skilled workers, such as engineers. According to MARGMA, the glove industry sees capex of RM0.6–1bn annually for expansion.
For Top Glove, MQ Research estimates a 10% windfall tax would reduce FY21E earnings by 12% and would require MQ Research’s target PE to rise to 25x from 23x to maintain the current target price of RM30.40 – which MQ Research does not believe is a lofty ask. Even with a 10% windfall tax, MQ Research’s FY21E EPS estimate would still be 20% above consensus.
For Hartalega, MQ Research estimates a 10% windfall tax would reduce FY21E earnings by 13% and require MQ Research’s target PE to rise to 53x from 51x to sustain the current target price of RM17.00. Even with a 10% windfall tax, MQ Research’s FY21E EPS estimate would still be 25% above consensus.
Bonus issue increases trading liquidity. Top Glove and Supermax (Not rated) have proposed 2-for-1 and 1-for-1 bonus issues, respectively, which are expected to be complete by 3Q20 and 4Q20. The issue for Top Glove would not have an impact on MQ Research ‘s estimates but could improve trading liquidity. The issues would benefit Bursa Malaysia (BURSA MK, RM8.60, Outperform, TP: RM10.00) (bull-case valuation of RM11.62), as the glove sector collectively accounts for 36% of its total market value currently. (Bursa Malaysia – Go with the flows)
Outlook
MQ Research reiterates its overweight view on the rubber glove sector.
12-month Target Price Methodology
TOPG MK: RM30.40 based on a price to earnings ratio (PER) methodology
HART MK: RM17.00 based on a PER methodology

Yesterday I have posted my article namely “Price Chart can help investors”. After checking the price charts which helped me to make investment decision, I sold Comfort and Supermax to buy Top Glove. The reason is that in the last few months, Supermax has shot up 920%, Comfort shot up 457% and Top Glove shot up only 382%.
There is an old English saying “I put my money where my mouth is” which means I do what I said. Another old English saying “I walk the talk” also means the same thing.
Yesterday I sold 2,521,500 Comfort at Rm4.16 and 1,057,000 Supermax at Rm 18.83 and bought 1,618,200 Top Glove at Rm 25.00. RHB Investment Bank Perak regional manager Mr Sim can confirm this transaction.
Those who have been following my buy recommendation for Comfort and Supermax might feel unhappy because I sold Comfort and Supermax. They should not be unhappy because both of the shares have made new high and they all have made a lot of money. I sold Supermax because it has shot up about 10 times in the last few months. In any case, I do not think its share price will drop because yesterday it has announced that shareholder will be given 1 bonus share for every 2 share you hold. I will buy back at cheaper price after the price correction.

It can help investors to make good investment decision.
The Covid 19 pandemic is affecting all the listed companies with the exception of medical gloves and medical products that can prevent contacting the coronavirus. As a result, the demand for gloves far exceeds supply and all the glove makers can increase their selling price easily to make more and more profit which are being reflected on their share prices. All the glove makers do not have the same margin of profit. Moreover, the share price movements of all the glove makers do not move up at the same rate.  
In view of all these complications, the price charts can help investors to make good investment decision. The 3 charts below show the price movement of Comfort, Top Glove and Supermax in the last 6 months.
 Comfort shot up from 90 sen to close at Rm 4.11, an increase of 457%.
Top Glove shot up from Rm 6.50 to close at Rm 24.80, an increase of 382%
Supermax shot up from Rm 2.00 to close at Rm 18.40, an increase of 920%.
Based of the above comparison, investors should sell Supermax to buy Top glove and Comfort. I prefer to buy Top Glove because it is more than double the size of Supermax in terms of manufacturing capacity and a world leader in this glove business.

将与国际顾问合作
苏巴马廉在“2020年投资大马：虚拟系列2”上说，协会已透过线上视讯向美方了解详请，发现问题主要出在招聘费和补救措施不足2大层面。
“我们已落实零招聘费政策，同时继续与国际顾问合作，希望从源头开始解决问题。”
他说，手套业虽是个小领域，外劳雇佣人数仅为4万人，但一直都努力履行社会责任。
“我们一直都在做对的事情，以确保领域处于发展正轨。”
我国手套业近年饱受剥削外劳指控所苦，并频频遭到外国政府采取对付行动，其中顶级手套在面对上述美国禁令前，也曾在2018年遭汤森路透基金会指控强迫劳工每月超时工作，并引来英国卫生部调查。此外，美国海关及边境保卫局也在去年曾向另一家手套商——WRP亚太私人有限公司祭出产品进口暂扣令，但暂扣令已在今年3月取消。
苏巴马廉指出，手套业必须正视外劳课题，因为人力特别是外劳不足将是钳制领域增长的一大因素。
需紧急增聘2.5万外劳
“我们预期要满足全球日趋高涨的需求，我们需要紧急增聘2万5000名外劳，因此协会正与政府合作解决外劳短缺问题。”
他了解政府解决外劳问题的用意，但认为政府应与国内制造业共同制定中长期计划来减低对外劳的依赖，而不是制定会带来膝跳效应（Knee-jerk）的短期措施。
暴利税打击投资
“此外，手套业者也将与政府合作进一步推动自动化，以解决外劳短缺问题。”
至于政府可能对橡胶手套领域祭出“暴利税”冲击，苏巴马廉说，手套业者每年将盈利的25%上缴国库，年均再投资金额达到6亿至10亿令吉，若政府开征暴利税可能抑制领域投资胃纳。
“政府想要从更高的盈利中分得更多的份额，还是让领域丧失竞争优势，政府需要衡量轻重。”
手套出口需求料增20%
为国家带来218亿收入
苏巴马廉透露，橡胶手套厂商协会预期今年手套出口需求将增长20%，至3300亿只，有望为国家带来218亿令吉出口收入，而随著疫情持续延烧，相关预测可能进一步上修。
“在疫情前，手套订单的周转周期（L e a dTime）为2个月，现在已经拉长至6个月，甚至是10至12个月，厂商才有望满足需求，总体需求依旧强劲。
价格方面，当前每盒手套价格已从疫情前的40美元涨至60美元，现货价更飙至120美元或以上。”
他补充，在过去18年，全球手套需求平均增长12%，相信随著卫生意识提高及非医疗领域需求增加，可能抵销疫情后医疗领域需求减少缺口，预见手套需求将持续增长，增速更可能较疫情前为快。
无惧中国厂商 大马优势多
询及来势汹汹的中国手套厂商会否对国内领域带来冲击，苏巴马廉对此不感忧虑，主要是大马在认证、品质等层面仍潜存优势，研发成就更是较其他国家超前5至8年时间。
“和建方舱医院不一样，中国是否能在短时间内建立起完善的手套生态系统，值得商榷。更重要的是，大马依旧是手套采购商的首选。除非我们满足不了采购商需求，订单才会外移至其他国家。”
此外，他认为，中国人均手套消耗量仍低，当地厂商扩充的产能将优先满足国内需求，并不会对出口市场带来过大影响。

勿见手套便买”
买卖回沽凭单应谨慎
手套股上涨，HA和HB也疯狂！
近期手套股因疫情关系大涨，股价以几倍飙涨；除了凭单趁势大涨，回沽凭单（Put Warrant）也大热！
一家散户业务颇多的证券行主管涂慧翎表示，目前热烈参与马股市的散户，可能赶不上乘手套股顺风车，希望不是“见手套便买”的一时失误，而可能面临严重后果。
涂慧翎告诉《星洲财经》，她认为虽然散户“疯狂”
买进手套股的HA与HB等回沽凭单，却可能还搞不清楚这类证券的操作。
凭单届满可变废纸
她提醒说，散户须注意的是，这些凭单到了届满期，可能只沦为一文不值的废纸。
涂慧翎评论近期回沽凭单上涨时指出，这种涨势可能是在散户热烈买进而驱动，纯是炒作居多，并不能持续。
她观察到，在上周一，正当手套股上涨之际，上述回沽凭单也上涨200%。
她促请散户避开风险，不要在未搞清状况前盲目买进这些凭单，在随著“音乐椅”的音乐起舞之际，投资者应趁音乐未停止前出清这些凭单。
她以一项距今还有7个月到期的手套股回沽凭单为例说，投资者购买后须于届满日以每股12令吉脱售母股。
基于行使比例是50对1，因此意味以50回沽凭单转换1母股。
她提醒的几项事实是，当母股高于12令吉时，这些回沽凭单大有可能沦为废纸，在期满时不值一文。
其次，即使投资者认为该母股价格会跌至低于12令吉，单单转换1母股的成本，就相等于21.5仙乘以50，而得出10令吉75仙。
“即使该股价跌破12令吉，投资者在转换时仍难以取回成本，每转换1母股要亏上1令吉25仙。”
涂慧翎说，上述母股价需跌至每股1令吉25仙，投资者才能两不亏盈。
无论如何，一般而言，就回沽凭单及回购凭单（CallWarrant）等股票衍生投资工具来说，投资者普遍视为“纸上投资”，多不会在届满时将这类凭单转换为母股，与上市公司发行的股票转换凭单（Warrant）不同，因而回沽凭单及回购凭单的投资风险也更高。

topglove,"Mon, 20 Jul 2020, 6:05 PM",Top Glove - Proposed 2 for 1 Bonus Issue - Bimb Research Highlights | I3investor,https://klse.i3investor.com/blogs/bimbresearch/2020-07-20-story-h1510783099-Top_Glove_Proposed_2_for_1_Bonus_Issue.jsp,"Top Glove (TOPG) is proposing a bonus share issue of up to 5,476.97m new shares on the basis of 2 shares for every 1 existing held at an entitlement date to be determined later.
The exercise sees an adjustment in Top Glove’s FY21F EPS to 44.7sen and ex-bonus adjusted TP of RM10.30 (from current TP of RM31.30).
Top Glove’s prospect remains positive backed by continued strong demand and higher ASPs on increasing global Covid-19 infections.
Maintain BUY with TP of RM31.30 based on 23x PER pegged on FY21 EPS.
Proposed 2 for 1 bonus issue.
TOPG has proposed a bonus issue of up to 5,476.97m new shares on the basis of two bonus shares for every one existing TOPG’s share held at an entitlement date to be determined later. As at 6 July 2020, the company’s issued share capital was RM1589.7m comprising 2,694.7m shares (including 661,600 treasury shares) and will result in minimum enlarged number of shares to 8084.1m upon completion of bonus issue.
In addition, the company also has 23.5m outstanding options granted under the employees’ share scheme (ESOS) and USD30.3m (RM123.5m) 5-years Guaranted Exchangeable Bonds convertible into 20.2m new TOPG shares. Assuming all the outstanding ESOS options and Exchangeable Bonds share are exercised prior to the implementation of the proposed bonus issue, 5,476.97m bonus shares will be issued. This will result in maximum enlarged number of shares to 8,215.5m (table 1). The proposed bonus issue is expected to be completed by the end of 3Q2020.
Bonus to improve liquidity of shares
We view this move as positive. The exercise serves as a reward for TOPG existing shareholders as well as improve the shares trading liquidity. Upon completion of bonus issue of up to 5,476.97m (taking maximum scenario), there will be a dilution in the group’s FY21F EPS from 136sen to 44.7sen. The theoretical price of ex-bonus (based on our TP of RM31.30) will be RM10.30.
Outlook remains strong
Our bullish outlook on TOPG remains, given strong demand visibility to continue into 2021. This is supported by increasing number of infections including resurgent cases which had surpassed 14.6m people globally. With regards to the US Customs detention order, TOPG is in discussion with the US authorities and is confident that it can be resolved very shortly (within 1 months)
Maintain BUY with TP RM31.30
Maintain BUY with TP of RM31.30 (ex-bonus adjusted priced of RM10.30). Our valuation is based on 23x PER pegged on astronomical growth of 163% yoy in FY21 EPS to 136 sen. We like Top Glove due to i) ability to supply in current tight market conditions with greater excess capacity compared to its peers, ii) higher ASP increase among OEM players as they are a major supplier with a diversified customer base, and iii) experienced management.

And, with the recent strong price gains of the other two large glove makers SUPERMX (OP; TP: RM17.10) and KOSSAN (OP; TP: RM14.00), they have fairly promising chances of making it into the FBMKLCI at the next review’s cut-off in November, if they finish the year strongly as per expectations. The crowding into the gloves sector due not only to their potential enlargement in index representations but also passive healthcare ETF inflows from abroad will structurally elevate the PE multiple of the FBMKLCI, which may eventually place Malaysian equity market at an increased premium over those in the rest of ASEAN.
Increased earnings estimates for rubber gloves manufacturers have raised FBMKLCI FY20/FY21 estimates by 1.4%/6.2%: Our analyst Raymond Choo raised EPS estimates for TOPGLOV, HARTA and SUPERMX last week (13th July) which led to FBMKLCI EPS being raised as well (see table 1 below).
Rubber glove has the highest sector growth estimates for FY20/21 within our research universe: Reflecting the latest earnings estimates (see table 2 below), we raised the FBMKLCI’s year-end target from 1,531 to 1,618. The target is arrived at by applying a 17.4x PE multiple to 93.2 sen EPS vs. 87.8 sen previously. 17.4x 1-year forward PE is based on a blended PE of 16.2x on FBMKLCI ex-gloves EPS and 26.6x on gloves EPS. And, 16.2x is 1SD above the 10-year mean, justified by the current low risk-free rate.
From a bottom-up perspective, the FBMKLCI could potentially reach 1,673 based on our latest target prices for TOPGLOV and HARTA: We estimate that each 10% movement in the price of TOPGLOV would move the FBMKLCI by 12 points, and by 8 points in the case of HARTA. Our target prices are RM32.00 for TOPGLOV and RM22.30 for HARTA. These are some 39% and 30% upside, respectively, from their current market prices. Inputting these target prices into the KLCI pricing model yields a level of 1,673 (see table 3).
With a strong expected year-end finish for the gloves sector, there is a fair chance the FBMKLCI will see one or two new inclusions: The ground rules state that a non-component stock will be included if it has risen to at least 25th position by market cap. As of 17th July closing prices, SUPERMX at RM17.70 already ranks 20th. Although KOSSAN at RM13.50 ranks only 26th, it might still be admitted by default as the largest non-constituent to replace an outgoing component, if any that has fallen to 36th place or below. KLCCP and GENM look vulnerable given their current 32nd and 33rd positions, respectively.

Rubber gloves entering Australia from Malaysia could be linked to forced labour, with US restricting imports
By Max Walden
Posted 5hhours ago , updated 40mminutes ago
Malaysian medical glove producer Top Glove has long faced accusations of forced labour practices.(Supplied)

  Rubber gloves used in Australia's fight against coronavirus could be produced by slave labour, corporate watchdogs warn, after the United States banned imports of products from the world's largest manufacturer.
Key points:
The pandemic has seen a huge boost in demand for rubber gloves from Malaysia, which is the world's largest producer
Australian journalists facing jail in Malaysia were investigating mistreatment of migrant workers
Observers say companies in Australia's healthcare sector are among the worst when it comes to supply chain transparency
Malaysia's Top Glove, which is estimated to produce one in five gloves globally, had a detention order imposed on its products by US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) on July 15.
This means its products will be detained by US authorities until Top Glove either exports the shipment from American soil or can demonstrate that the merchandise was not produced with forced labour.
A spokesperson for the CBP told the ABC the decision was ""based on reasonable evidence of forced labour in the manufacturing process"".
""The evidence reveals multiple International Labour Organization (ILO) indicators of forced labour, including debt bondage, excessive overtime, retention of identification documents, and abusive working and living conditions,"" they said.
In a statement responding to the detention order, Top Glove said it had ""already resolved"" alleged labour violations against migrant workers at its facilities.
""There is a possibility this may be related to foreign labour issues, which we have already resolved, save for one more issue with regard to retrospective payment of recruitment fees by our workers to agents prior to January 2019, without our knowledge,"" the company said.
A widely reported form of labour violation in Malaysia is the charging of extortionate recruitment fees by middlemen, which watchdogs say leads to bonded labour — the most common form of modern slavery — as workers are forced to use modest salaries to pay back the fees over long periods of time.

Top Glove said it had paid back all recruitment fees to employees ""over the past few months"".
""We believe it is in the best interests of all parties to come to a solution expeditiously so that our disposable gloves can reach the parties that need it the most, during this COVID-19 time,"" the company said.
Top Glove did not respond to the ABC's request for comment.
Amy Sinclair, regional representative in Australia for the Business & Human Rights Resource Centre, said: ""This really should be a very live issue for Australian companies who are importing from Malaysia, where we know that there are issues and we know there is a history of poor practices.""

'The world relies on Malaysia'
The COVID-19 pandemic has seen an unprecedented surge in demand for personal protection equipment (PPE), particularly from Malaysia, which is thought to produce upwards of 60 per cent of the world's gloves.
In March, the US embassy in Kuala Lumpur declared that ""the world relies on Malaysia in the fight against COVID-19"".
Top Glove's revenue has skyrocketed as a result, reporting an incredible 366 per cent jump in net profit for the third quarter of 2020.
The company last month lauded ""unparalleled growth"" and its ""most outstanding performance yet"", with executive director Lim Cheong Guan telling reporters that: ""The best is yet to come.""
But there are indications that boosted production has taken a toll on workers.
An investigation by local news outlet Malaysiakini, released in early May, found that Top Glove was operating an initiative called Heroes for COVID-19, whereby workers were encouraged to spend up to four hours on their days off packing rubber gloves to meet demand.
""I don't feel like a hero at all,"" one worker, who said they had worked 14 days straight, told Malaysiakini.
A separate investigation by the UK's Channel 4 found that Top Glove workers were being paid less than $2-an-hour to work 12-hour shifts, 6 days a week.
Finnish Member of European Parliament Heidi Hautala and six other MEPs wrote to the EU's Commissioner for Trade in late May over ""systemic and documented forced labour concerns"" in Malaysia's glove-making industry.
""Illegal recruitment fees, long hours, low pay, passport confiscation and squalid, overcrowded accommodation are commonplace,"" Ms Hautala wrote.
""Such conditions leave workers, who are often foreign workers from countries such as Bangladesh, Myanmar and Nepal, vulnerable to forced labour and debt bondage, which are modern forms of slavery.""
Top Glove insists it has resolved what it calls ""foreign labour issues"".(Reuters: Anas Zakwan via Top Glove)
""These rubber glove factories are working overtime right now to meet the vast amount of supply that the world needs,"" said Brian Yap of Amnesty International Malaysia.
""The companies and the government must ensure that these workers, who are doing a very important job, are protected from injury and disease.""
Longstanding concerns over abuse of workers in Malaysia
Abuses in the glove manufacturing industry in Malaysia have been widely documented long before COVID-19.
An ABC investigation in 2018 found overcrowded worker accommodation and allegations of excessive overtime, salary deductions, large recruitment fees and workers having their passports locked up at Top Glove, which employs more than 11,000 workers from poorer countries.
""Passports being withheld — it happens across the board,"" Mr Yap of Amnesty told the ABC.
""I think technically it's illegal to do that as an employer, but it's a widely open and accepted practice.""
Arrests of undocumented migrants followed public anger at the presence of foreigners, particularly Rohingya refugees, in Malaysia during the pandemic.(Reuters: Lim Huey Teng)
The Government of Mahathir Mohamad, elected in 2018, had vowed to improve conditions for migrant workers in Malaysia.
But the toppling of Mr Mahathir and a securitised response to COVID-19 have seen crackdowns against undocumented migrants, including mass arrests.
The treatment of migrant workers in Malaysia was the focus of a recent Al Jazeera documentary, which provoked an angry response from the Malaysian Government and could see five Australian journalists charged.

Australia's Modern Slavery Act
Unlike the US, Australia does not require importers to prove there is no forced labour in their supply chain.
Nevertheless, a spokesperson for the Australian Border Force told the ABC: ""The Government is concerned by allegations of modern slavery relating to the manufacture of personal protective equipment, including rubber gloves.""
""Australia is taking a global leadership role in addressing modern slavery risks in international supply chains through our Modern Slavery Act 2018,"" they said.
""Under the Act, entities based or operating in Australia which have an annual consolidated revenue of more than $100 million are required to report on their actions to assess and address possible modern slavery risks in their supply chains. This may include modern slavery risks related to the purchase of PPE.""
The Law Council of Australia has previously criticised the Act, arguing it may be too weak to have any impact on the practice.
""It's weak because it doesn't have financial penalties,"" Ms Sinclair of the Business & Human Rights Resource Centre said.
""But it is a quite significant first step and it does force companies to look at their supply chains and what the potential risks to workers are.""
The Australian Border Force has said it is concerned over allegations of forced labour in the production of PPE.(AAP: Dan Peled)
Companies required to report under the Act have been given an extension due to coronavirus and are not expected to submit their reporting until March.
Border Force issued an information sheet for businesses in April, detailing ""how to reduce the risk of vulnerable workers in their operations and supply chains becoming exposed to modern slavery"".
It has stopped short of banning the import of products suspected to have been manufactured with forced labour, however.
The US CBP spokesperson, meanwhile, told the ABC that: ""Imported goods produced with forced labour can present health and safety risks for US consumers.""
They said the detention order against Top Glove was sending a ""clear and direct message to US importers that the illicit, inhumane and exploitative practices of modern day slavery will not be tolerated in US supply chains"".
""CBP continues to work extremely hard …  to ensure that personal protective equipment, medical devices and pharmaceuticals related to the COVID-19 response are cleared for entry as expeditiously as possible, while verifying that those goods are authorised and safe for use,"" they said.
""Consumers can use their economic power to help combat forced labour by demanding more information about the origin of goods that they purchase and by refusing to buy goods made with forced labour.""
The coronavirus pandemic has seen an unprecedented increase in demand for PPE.(Pxfuel)
Health sector 'one of the worst' for ethical supply chain
In March, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that to meet global demand, manufacturing of PPE would have to be increased by 40 per cent.
""Industry and governments must act quickly to boost supply, ease export restrictions and put measures in place to stop speculation and hoarding. We can't stop COVID-19 without protecting health workers first,"" said WHO director-general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
""Without secure supply chains, the risk to healthcare workers around the world is real,"" he said.
War on waste in hospitals
Robyn Parkin of Ethical Partners Fund Management told the ABC that while ensuring there is adequate PPE for medical workers is important, the healthcare sector often lacks appropriate concern for the wellbeing of workers responsible for manufacturing the goods overseas.
""We have also done a lot of research on the attention to modern slavery across the ASX as a whole, and surprisingly, as a sector, the health sector is amongst the worst for disclosure and transparency,"" she said.
""We always find this really interesting philosophically, that a sector that is focussed on people and caring is one of the worst at dealing with their social footprint.""
Australia's Department of Health did not respond to the ABC's inquiries about the quantity of rubber gloves purchased by the Commonwealth Government and whether Top Glove products were among those purchased.
""It's really critical at this time [that] efforts to protect all workers are redoubled,"" Ms Sinclair said.
""Companies should be ensuring that rigorous checks are still being taken, that they are checking what their suppliers are doing, and that they are using their leverage to encourage their suppliers to prioritise health and safety at this time."""

And the reality of Topglove being the world's largest glove manufacturer during 1 of 3 pandemic of the last century, which is still without a vaccine, has calmed investor fears. Share prices are up by 17% from the weekday lows and the irrational Bears have receded. However another particular cry has started to occur, that from Bulls, who are making humorous or flippant calls for people to put all their money into glove stocks, perhaps to the point of mortgaging their cat.
I find it funny myself, but that being said, I am concerned that some people might actually do that, put all their money that they have into glove shares. From a financial point of view, investing all your money in Topglove certainly promises a large rate of return, which even now may still reach 160%. However I would be a little more cautious. The market is not exactly rational and neither are some of the actions of nations in this pandemic.

For example, we saw a sell off from RM25.16 to RM20.50 just because Moderna announced it would begin its Phase II/III trial... a trial that would be completed on October 2022. Not only is this 2 years in the future but they still don't have evidence that their vaccine would work. Then we had a US ban on half of Topglove exports into the country over a mostly resolved case. This ban is an action that the US cannot possibly afford or sustain, as 25% of its 50 States are less than 30 days away from exhausting their PPE supplies.
Yet how many people lost money last week’s selling at 20.50, 19.70 and 19.60?  All those losses happened in a Friday (10/7/2020) to Friday (17/10/2020) period that saw a rise of RM1.06 from RM21.92 to RM22.98.

The fundamentals of Topglove and all large major glove companies in Malaysia are presently iron solid, impossible to deny as we can see the actual driver of glove demand, Covid19 growing exponential on the news, backed by biology, medical practice and human physics. Presidents and CEO may demand a vaccine now but they won’t get it any sooner. Scientist cannot work more than 24 hours in a day nor can cells grow any faster in an experiment. Yet, market sentiment is like an easily panicked goat and about as intelligent as one too.
In the long term, TG share prices will rise, mirroring the fundamental increase in demand for more gloves as the world both fights the Covid19 pandemic and struggles to keep businesses open. But in the short term anything can happen. There are over 500 phase I/II trials, and over 300 Phase II/III trials of various treatments, some of which are really far out including BCG vaccination, which if truly protective, no Malaysian would have caught Covid19 and honey… Yes, honey. Just goes to show that about every company is running their own Covid19 trial to make a buck. Maybe next month, we get rumors that Egyptian Honey can cure Covid19 and for some reason everyone believes it, panics and cause share price to fall -30%.
Can you stay rational enough in a panicked sell off to say ""This is stupid!"" and avoid joining in yourself. It is harder to stay rational if you put all your net worth into one investment and just watched 30% of its value vanish in a matter of days. This July 14 panic attack lasted 4 trading days. The attack before that lasted 11 trading days. Both saw a peak to trough of -28%. And the attack before that, Jun 2, lasted 2 trading days and saw a 53% decline.
I am sure most of us have no need from this article and will find the message common sense. But for those just entering the stock market, a small suggestion, ""Don’t put in so much money that you have trouble staying rational during a dip"". The coming quarters for Topglove (and other major glove companies) are going to be some of the most profitable in their company history and it would be a shame if the only people who profited from it are foreign institutional investors, buying shares cheap off panicked Malaysian retail investors. Don't morgage your cat to invest in Topglove, it would be hard to think rationally."

BATU BERENDAM: Kerajaan sedang mengadakan rundingan dengan Kedutaan Amerika Syarikat di ibu negara berhubung sekatan oleh Jabatan Kastam dan Perlindungan Sempadan (CBP) negara itu terhadap produk keluaran anak syarikat Top Glove Corp Bhd dari Malaysia.

Menteri Kanan Perdagangan Antarabangsa dan Industri (MITI), Datuk Seri Mohamed Azmin Ali berkata, tindakan AS menyekat eksport produk berkenaan adalah tidak wajar memandangkan  syarikat bertaraf antarabangsa itu telah menyalur bantuan besar ketika dunia berperang dengan pandemik COVID-19.
 
Beliau berkata, rundingan itu juga bagi memastikan industri sarung tangan pakai buang itu tidak terjejas lebih-lebih lagi pada fasa pasca pandemik COVID-19 ini.
  “Kita berharap pentadbiran AS dapat memberikan keadilan kepada syarikat bertaraf antarabangsa ini yang telah memberikan bantuan yang besar ketika Perintah Kawalan Pergerakan (PKP) baru-baru ini.

“Oleh sebab itu, kerajaan melalui MITI telah memberi kebenaran kepada syarikat yang mengeluarkan produk perkhidmatan dan peralatan perubatan ini untuk beroperasi sepenuhnya ketika PKP kerana permintaan tinggi di seluruh dunia selain memastikan kita dapat menangani penularan COVID-19.
  “Namun jika terdapat isu tertentu, pastinya kita akan berbincang dan cuba meyakinkan pihak berkuasa bahawa Top Glove perlu diberi kebenaran untuk meneruskan operasi dan mengeksport produk mereka ke pasaran AS,” katanya.

Beliau berkata demikian selepas mengadakan lawatan kerja ke kilang Texas Instruments Electronics Malaysia, di Batu Berendam, Melaka pada Sabtu.

Mengulas lanjut ujarnya, Top Glove juga sedang berurusan dengan pihak Kastam Amerika Syarikat bagi memperjelaskan dakwaan berhubung isu buruh paksa yang dilontarkan sehingga memgakibatkan syarikat antarabangsa itu diletakkan dalam senarai sekatan.
 
Terdahulu, berdasarkan laman web rasmi CBP AS, dua anak syarikat Top Glove iaitu Top Glove Sdn Bhd dan TG Medical Sdn Bhd telah diletakkan dalam senarai sekatan.

Walaupun tiada sebab dinyatakan, tindakan itu dipercayai berpunca daripada dakwaan bahawa Top Glove menggunakan khidmat buruh paksa.

Top Glove working to resolve US sanctions, says Azmin
  TOP Glove Corp Bhd is working to address the detention order imposed by the United States (US) Customs on imports from two of its subsidiaries to ensure undisrupted supply of rubber gloves amidst the global Covid-19 crisis.
Senior minister cum International Trade and Industry Minister Mohamed Azmin Ali said the company is currently engaging with US authorities after the US Customs placed Top Glove Sdn Bhd and TG Medical Sdn Bhd on its withhold release order list – a move taken against firms suspected of using forced labour.

TOPG’s gloves are now being detained at the ports of entry in the US, similarly for any incoming shipments too starting 15 July 2020
Management has guided that they will be working with relevant authorities to resolve the matter within the next 2 weeks
Foreign Labour Issue Haunts TOPG Again
Although the CBP did not provide additional details about the detention orders, TOPG’s management believe that it could be related to its past foreign labour issues, in regards to the retrospective payment of recruitment fees by their workers to agents prior to January 2019, which TOPG is already is the midst of resolving the issue. Management also reiterated that their current labour policies have already complied with international standards, and have passed the audits by external parties. TOPG has engaged an external consultant, and we are confident that TOPG can resolve the problem in the coming weeks easily, as the issue is mainly related to past practices.
There Is Still Strong Demand From Other Regions Too
Although the US market contributes around 25% of sales in FY19, we are not revising our numbers as we believe TOPG can resolve the problem in a timely manner. As there is shortage of gloves globally, we believe that TOPG can sell its gloves to other countries if needed, if the suspension is prolonged during the COVID-19 crisis. There is a high likelihood that the problem will be resolved quickly, given the worsening outbreak of COVID-19 in the US, as CBP has recently lifted the suspension of another glove manufacturer due to the shortage in the US. ASP in the US is marginally higher than other regions by about 5%.
Reiterate BUY With An Unchanged TP of RM22.40
We believe that the sales to the US will only be temporarily disrupted by the current detention orders, hence we are keeping our earnings forecasts unchanged. As the current demand growth continues to outstrip supply, TOPG will continue to benefit from the rising ASP, in our view. As such, we are keeping our BUY call and TP at RM22.40 unchanged, based on unchanged 52x CY21E PER. Key risks to our call include: 1) intensifying competition from other countries; 2) higher volatility in rawmaterial prices; and 3) worsening labor issues.

Two of Top Glove's subsidiaries have been placed under a detention order by US Customs and Border Protection, which means that any disposable gloves distributed by these subsidiaries cannot be sold in the US. The move has only added to the glovemakers share price volatility, but a larger question persists: What will this mean for Top Glove's presence in the US market, which makes up 25% of total group sales?

However, the Group is confident that the issue could be resolved within 2 to 4 weeks, as soon as the Group reimburses its foreign workers with the agency fees paid previously. Should Top Glove fail to settle this issue, the Group can also opt to redirect its shipments to other countries. On a side note, we raise our earnings forecast for FY20-22F by 37-60%, as we take into account the effects of the stronger-than-expected ASP hike in the coming months. However, given the current overhang situation, we lower our PE multiple to 26x (at +0.5SD of its 5-year historical mean), awaiting a resolution on this issue. Our TP is subsequently raised to RM23, maintain Trading Buy. Downside risk to our call includes (i) possible derating should the Covid-19 outbreak start to show signs of subsiding, (ii) ASP not able to sustain at high levels and (iii) the European countries to follow suit and block the entry of Top Glove’s shipments.
Background of the issue. It was brought to light that disposable gloves manufactured under two of Top Glove’s subsidiaries, Top Glove SB and TG Medical SB has been served a detention order by the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP). Top Glove has highlighted that the ban could likely be due to the recruitment fees paid by their foreign workers to the agents, prior to starting work in Malaysia, of which it is an unacceptable practice in the eyes of labor activists. We also note that, after the Zero Recruitment Fee Policy implementation in January 2019, Top Glove has since been bearing all recruitment fees incurred.
Actions taken. Top Glove is currently reaching out to CBP to understand the basis of the detention order on its glove shipments and the Group has also engaged a third-party independent consultant to help lift the detention order. The said consultant had previously helped uplift the detention order imposed onto WRP as well.
Implications. Top Glove’s management is positive that the issue in hand can be resolved within 2-4 weeks’ time, as long as the Group reimburse its foreign workers with the agent fees incurred, of which the total sum is estimated to range between RM20m to RM50m. Top Glove is also optimistic that they could reach a quick settlement with CBP, especially during this crucial time.

In the interim, Top Glove will continue shipping its gloves to the US and park the inventories at the Free Trade Zone. Once the matter is resolved, the gloves are expected to be released to its customers in the US immediately. However, if Top Glove fail to sort out the problem with CBP, the Group can choose to reroute the shipments to other countries. Given the strong glove demand, the shipments are expected to be taken up swiftly. We highlight that North America accounts for 25% of the Group’s topline, while both the subsidiaries mentioned above accounts for half of the total sales from US, at c.12.5%.
Our view. We believe that the Group’s huge order backlog will certainly help to mitigate the impact of this unanticipated detention order as it can redirect its shipments away from the US and to be absorbed by other countries. However, if the underlying issue of the detention order differs from Top Glove’s expectations and could not be solved in a timely manner, we think that the Group would be negatively impacted as it is unsure at this juncture whether the CBP would impose a blanket ban onto all of Top Glove’s subsidiaries and the North American region accounts for a whopping 25% of its sales

Products from two subsidiaries placed under US detention order
Neutral on the news as issue should resolve within 2 weeks
Muted earnings impact
Earnings estimate maintained
Maintain BUY with unchanged TP of RM26.12
Two subsidiaries placed under US detention order. Top Glove announced that the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) had placed a detention order on disposable gloves manufactured by two of its subsidiaries, namely Top Glove Sdn Bhd and TG Medical Sdn Bhd on 15th
July 2020. Top Glove revealed that there is a possibility that this may be related to foreign labour issues whereby the reimbursement cost is estimated in the range of RM20m to RM50m.
Neutral on the news as issue should resolve within 2 weeks. We are neutral on the news as Top Glove are reaching out to the CBP through their office in US and engaging a third-party independent consultant to work towards a speedy resolution of the matter within an estimated 2 weeks. The shipments detained can be released once the detention order lifted. We gather that US accounts for about 25% of Top Glove’s sales volume while the two subsidiaries that have been placed under detention order accounted for 12.5% of its total sales. Meanwhile, Top Glove will continue ship stocks to the US and park at free trade zone. In a worst-case scenario, Top Glove could ship the stocks to other countries as demand for gloves is strong amid the Covid-19 pandemic.
Muted earnings impact. Earnings impact from the detention order is expected to be muted as Top Glove is confident to resolve the issue within 2 weeks. Besides, the estimated reimbursement cost of RM20m to RM50m to resolve the issue is minimal considering estimated earnings of >RM1b in FY20. Hence, we make no changes to our earnings forecast for FY20-22F.
Maintain BUY with unchanged TP of RM26.12. We maintain our TP for Top Glove at RM26.12, pegging FY21F EPS of 60.8sen at PER of 43x. We value Top Glove at its upcycle PER of +1SD 3-year historical mean PER in view of the positive outlook for gloves demand. We believe the positive earnings outlook for Top Glove is unfazed by the detention order as demand for gloves remains strong with average selling price of gloves remains on uptrend. Hence, we maintain our BUY call on Top Glove

Concurrently, in a well organised analysts’ briefing last evening, TOPGLOV assured us that it has engaged a consultant to resolve this issue and is confident of resolving it within two to four weeks. In the meantime, due to the acute supply shortage and supernormal demand, TOPGLOV can sell to other countries since the order lead time is >500 days. TP remains at RM32.00 based on 21.5x CY21E EPS. Reiterate Outperform.
US Customs detention order placed on TOPGLOV’s disposable gloves. In an announcement to Bursa Malaysia, TOPLGOV has confirmed that the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has placed a detention order on disposable gloves manufactured by two of the subsidiaries namely Top Glove Sdn Bhd and TG Medical Sdn Bhd. In the meantime, TOPGLOV is contacting CBP via its office in the U.S., customers and consultants, to understand the issue better and work towards a speedy resolution which is expected within 2 weeks. The group believes there is a possibility this may be related to foreign labour issues, which have already been resolved, save for one more issue with regard to retrospective payment of recruitment fees by workers to agents prior to January 2019, without their knowledge. However, Top Glove has already been bearing all recruitment fees since January 2019 when the Zero Recruitment Fee Policy was implemented. Over the past few months, the group has been working to establish the correct amount to be paid back to its workers, on behalf of the previous agents. The group estimated the total amount at between RM20m to RM50m or 1-4% of FY20E net profit. In the conference-call, management highlighted that plans are in motion to engage a consultant who had previously helped remove WRP from the detention list, to resolve the issue which is expected within 2-4 weeks. Management understands that the detention is in relation to (i) passport retention – in fact workers passports issue has been returned; and (ii) old recruitment fees highlighted above. These two subsidiaries accounted for TOPGLOV’s 12.5% sales volume to the US (of which total accounted for 25% in the US). In the meantime, the detained shipment can be parked at the warehouse in the free trade zone and if need be can be sold to nearby countries. We expect this issue to resolve amicably in a speedy manner. Moreover, the acute shortage of medical grade disposable gloves globally and the heightened cases in US means the urgency to reach the market place is far more important. In the meantime, due to the acute supply shortage and supernormal demand, TOPGLOV can sell to other countries since order lead time is >500 days.
Heads I win, Tails I win. For illustrative purposes, based on i) total capacity of 78b pieces per annum, ii) assuming the 12.5% of capacity from the two mentioned subsidiaries, iii) ASP of USD40/1000 pieces and USDMYR4.20, and iv) FY21E forecast net margin of 31%, our FY21E net profit is expected to be lowered by 13%. However, assuming the capacity is sold at spot price at USD60/1000 pieces to a new buyer with the rest of the assumptions remained equal mentioned above, our FY21E net profit will be higher by 6%.
Reiterate OP. We had earlier raised TP from RM25.00 to RM32.00 as per our last report on Monday 13th July. The higher TP was based on 21.5x CY21E’s raised EPS of 152.3 sen (vs 36x previously) (at +0.5 SD above 5-year historical forward mean). We lowered our PER rating as we believe valuations are pegged to supernormal earnings; hence, upside to peak earnings should have been factored in. Its merits are: (i) strong management, (ii) resilient earnings base due to its pricing power and its sheer size in capacity in the industry, and (iii) solid earnings growth averaging >100% in FY21 compared to PERs of 14x.
A key risk to our call is lower-than-expected volume sales and ASP

US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has placed a detention order on disposable gloves manufactured by 2 of its subsidiaries. The Group has organised a conference call regarding aforementioned issue. We are quite satisfied with the management’s explanations and the virtual briefing ended with a positive note in which the issue is expected to be resolved in 2 weeks’ time.
Comments
Market overreacts to the impasse. The similar issue has been raised to Top glove which was happened to other players such as Ansell, WRP, and Karex pursuant to forced labour issue. However, we are confident in the Group as it has obtained A+ rating in labour audit from a corresponding institution, after going through over 80+ audits in 2019. The Group is likely to weather the storm in a short period of time by reimbursing estimated RM20m–50m back to the labour agents. Also, Top glove has engaged with the consultant who had helped WRP to resolve the dispute earlier, and opine that the issue is unlikely to prolong based on the past cases or experience. Additionally, we understand that the Group has complied strictly with the 104 working hours rule which renders no basis of any labour abuse.
Demand-supply imbalance still persists. Top glove is flexible to divert the detention gloves (12.5% of total sales) strategically to any other countries to cater the overwhelming demand from North America region. At this moment, the detention gloves would be placed in Free Trade Zone accordingly for further action. Meanwhile, the record COVID- 19 cases in the region will continue to underpin the strong usage of gloves and demand is foreseen to be sustainable in the near future. In fact, the Group has received extra spot orders from nations that are currently relieved or spared from coronavirus as these governments pre-empt to the potential 2nd wave of COVID-19. Although the ASPs from the U.S orders are slightly higher compared with other countries or regions, we think the impact is not significant to the Group’s overall bottom line.
Earnings Outlook/Revision
We revise down our FY20F net earnings forecast by 2.8% to account for estimated RM45m payment to labour agents. Meanwhile, maintain our net earnings forecast for FY21F and FY22F.
Valuation & Recommendation
We advocate BUY on weakness with an unchanged target price of RM25.40. Our target price is pegged at 30x CY21F PER, which is in line with its 5-year historica mean PE on the back of brighter industry outlook as underpinned by the prevailing coronavirus pandemic, paradigm shift of long-term glove demand with higher hygienic consciousness coupled with rising US healthcare expenditure in coming years pursuant to potential win of Democratic candidate Joe Biden in upcoming US presidential election as empirical evidence suggests that glove manufactures are set to benefit from healthcare spending expansion by the U.S pursuant to comeback of Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) or “Obamacare”

NEWSBREAK
Top Glove confirmed that the US Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”) has placed a detention order on disposable gloves manufactured by its 2 subsidiaries (Top Glove Sdn Bhd and TG Medical Sdn Bhd) on 15 July 2020. Top Glove is reaching out to the CBP through their office in the US, customers and consultants, to understand the issue better and work towards a speedy resolution of the matter, within an estimated 2-4 weeks.
HLIB’s VIEW
We dialled into Top Glove’s conference call pertaining to above mention news.
Quick action. As we understand, Top Glove has engaged with a consultant to help remove it from the detention list; it is the same consultant which assisted WRP Asia Pacific SB (another glove manufacturer) to be released from the Withhold Release Order (WRO). It is presumed that the issue pertains to retrospective payment of recruitment fees by Top Glove’s foreign workers to agents prior to Jan 2019. Management reconfirmed that it has been bearing all recruitment fees since Jan 2019 when their “Zero Recruitment Fee Policy” was implemented. Over the past few months, Top Glove has been undertaking extensive tracing, to establish the correct amount to be paid back to its workers, on behalf of the previous agents (i.e. those prior to Jan 2019). The total amount is estimated at RM20-50m.
Estimated time frame. The 2 mentioned subsidiaries accounts for half of Top Glove’s North America sales or at 12.5% of the overall sales volume. Currently, the 2 subsidiaries are still able to ship goods to the US, however it will be parked at the warehouses/ free trade zones until the issue clears. Top Glove feels the time frame of 2-4 weeks is sufficient for it to be removed from the detention list. However, we believe if there are any delays in resolving the issue, Top Glove is capable to use its other subsidiaries to ship out the orders. We are also hopeful on the expected time frame given (i) current glove shortage in the market, (ii) strong backing of successful audits in the past (Top Glove is audited by 80-90 audits yearly), and (iii) supply of high-quality gloves.
High global demand. MARGMA’s projected 2020 glove global demand is 330bn gloves (+20% YoY vs. the usual 8-10%). If Top Glove continues to be in the detention list for a longer period of time, it could reallocate its output to other countries, aided by the strong demand for gloves worldwide. Paired with the shortage of gloves globally, we are optimistic that this issue will be resolve quickly as delays will further widen the demand-supply gap. Being the world’s largest glove producer, we feel that it is “too big of a shoe” to be filled by other glove makers.
Forecast. The RM20-50m payment would marginally dent our FY20 earnings forecast by 1-3% (adjusted for tax). Maintain forecast for now.
Maintain BUY, TP RM31.31. Maintain BUY with unchanged TP of RM31.31. Our TP is based on mid-FY21 earnings pegged to PE multiple of 33x (+1SD above 5 year mean). We feel that any share price weakness presents an opportune time to accumulate

The group said that the reason may be related to foreign labour issues with regards to the retrospective payment of recruitment fees.
Recall that the recruitment fees were paid by the workers prior to the implementation of the Zero Recruitment Fee Policy in January 2019. Top Glove is currently engaging with CBP to confirm the basis of the detention order.
Top Glove estimates around RM20mil-RM50mil as the amount to be paid back to its workers. This is roughly 2-4% of FY20F estimated net earnings of RM1.3bil.
The two subsidiaries listed under the detention list accounts for 50% of sales to the US, translating to roughly 12.5% of total group sales (total sales to the US were roughly 25% in FY19).
The gloves under detention can be recalled to be sold to customers in other countries. The average selling price (ASP) in the US is estimated to be at a 5% premium compared with that in other countries while spot prices are similar with other countries. Considering the current demand conditions, it will still be profitable for the group if they choose to reroute the gloves.
Top Glove is confident that the matter can be settled within 2-4 weeks. The group has engaged a consultant with experiences in dealing with similar issues.
We are neutral on this news as we think that Top Glove will be able to solve the matter within a month. We believe that in the worst case scenario, the group will not face problems selling its gloves to customers in other countries due to the high demand during the Covid-19 pandemic.

Read on for More.
Event
The United States Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has enforced a detention order on subsidiaries of Top Glove – Top Glove Sdn Bhd and TG Medical Sdn Bhd – to halt importation of medical gloves from the company. However, MQ Research believes the issue will be resolved quickly, especially given the current acute shortage of gloves and the fact that Top Glove supplies 20% of US glove demand.
Impact
Management indicates this detention order is due to foreign labour recruitment fees which were paid by workers to agents prior to January 2019. Top Glove is now working on this issue and estimates that the total amount paid by workers prior to 2019 was between RM20-50m. The company expects to resolve this issue within two weeks.
In MQ Research’s view, the prospects for this detention order being lifted are high as the market is experiencing an acute shortage and other manufacturers’ capacity is fully sold until June-21.
The longer the detention order is in place, the higher the risk for the US healthcare system. The United States is already facing shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) before Top Glove was placed under detention order. Top Glove accounts for 20% market share in the United States.
In order to replace Top Glove’s supply capacity, United States’ customers might have to purchase medical gloves from other manufacturers at spot price which is 2-3x higher than the normal average selling price (ASP). This might fuel a steep rise in PPE expense in the United States.
Recall, CBP took a similar action against another small Malaysian glove maker, WRP Asia Pacific Sdn Bhd, in 2019. However, the order was lifted in Mar-20 when COVID-19 spread to the United States and the country experienced a surge in glove demand.
Action and Recommendation
MQ Research maintains an Outperform rating with a RM30.40 target price (TP) based on 23x CY21E price to earnings ratio (PER). In MQ Research’s view, any pullback in share price performance will be a good opportunity to accumulate the shares.

If US CBP continues to ban the import of Top Glove’s gloves made in Malaysia, Top Glove can export its gloves made by its factories in China, Thailand etc besides Malaysia. US is not the only buyer of gloves. Moreover, Top Glove can increase its export to so many countries around the world. 
In any case, Comfort and Supermax are not concerned with Top Glove’s problem. In fact, Comfort and Supermax can take advantage of the situation to increase their selling price to make more profit.
Currently there are 13,732, 000 Covid 19 cases and 587,728 deaths around the world. These 2 figures are still spiking higher and higher. There are more than 200,000 new cases every day as shown on the chart below.  
  Currently, there are 3,618,739 Covid 19 cases and 140,185 deaths in US and the number of new cases is still spiking higher and higher as shown on the chart below.
  As a result, the demand for gloves will continue to exceed supply and all the glove makers are increasing their selling prices to make more profit which should be reflected on their share prices.
I trust this article can help investors to think logically to make more money. Investors should be able to understand my article to hold on to their shares instead of rushing to dump their holdings. Investor who have buying power should take advantage of the situation to buy more shares. Remember this is a rare opportunity to make more money.

  I am reproducing this summary from smallkid91 at TOPGLOV FORUM to my blog.
smallkid91 Zoom call summary: please buy me a pizza :p missed the first part.

US total revenue is 25% of top glove.
12.5% of the revenue are affected by the hold order. Another 12.5% can still be shipped.
WRP took couple of months to resolve this. 2 months after engaging consultant.
Topglov is consulting the same consultant with WRP, and believe to resolve this in matter of weeks.
Topglov management have not meet with committees from border control.
Topglov had 80audits last year.
Topglov believe customer will follow through their orders instead of cancelling.
Topglov price difference between US ASP and others is 5% for non spot order. Similarly priced for spot order.

Topglove safety safety safety. Improve improve.

But it seems like topglove management does not show much emphathy. Probably good for our bottom line :P 16/07/2020 6:29 PM

I am reproducing this summary from sypher at  GLOV private discussion room to my blog.

Stephanie CLSA
1. CBP will do the same to other subsidiaries?
Tan Sri: only 2 for now, the rest is up to them.
2. 50million sufficient?
Tan Sri: WRP pay 20 million ringgit, Karex also not much, Ansell also pay less than 20million ringgit.
Dato KM Lee: WRP is different, their issue is far more serious as they dont pay workers salary for 3 months.

Random guy
1. How often TG audit?
Dato KM Lee: last year we have 80 audits. This year about 10 audits due to Covid 19. We welcome them to come and see how is it. Wish we can invite CBP to come and audit us before they take action. Bear in mind a lot of ambassador also came to audit us, like US Nepal Indonesian, Belgium, Germany and etc. they even interview our workers. All of them are happy with what they seen. Malaysian authority also came, nothing like Chanel 4 shows. Police, Miti, Mpk , JTK, KKM all came to visit. They are happy with visit. We have enough of report, its good to clear this once and for all.
Tan Sri Lim: last 1 year we have audit almost everyday (80 audits a year).

Steve Lo
1. How long WRP got rid of the detention?
Dato KM Lee: shareholder issue, legal issue and management issue, customer issue, hence they took a few months, more than 2 months. Their company was in a mess, so they took long time. TG has strong team and we have US office, we been dealing with FDA for long time.

Allen Lim
1. What’s the ASP for US and non US? In percentage?
KM Lee: almost same for spot orders. Australia Spot also come in strongly. Normal orders about 5%.

Sam
1. All top glove cannot enter US for now?
KM Lee: not true, still can ship but pending due to CBP.
2. CBP detention Does that cover all glove?
TS LIM: only 2 subsidiaries, take up about 12.5% of our total 20% export  to US only.

  I am reproducing this text message from a telegram group to my blog.
  Date: 16 July 2020, 530PM
Management: Cheong Guan, Tan Sri Lim and Dato Lee

Action mgmt will take? - 1) TOPG US office has engaged with CBP - find out why are the reason/s they put TOPG into the list. 2) called consultations which got WRP to get out their detention order previously. Confident to overcome the challenges in the short period of time ~2-4 weeks. WRP was off the detention list within 2 weeks because the US need gloves urgently.

What’s the progress of 2019’s claims? Workers need to pay agency fees previously. TOPG took action and no longer collect agency fees. Estimated RM20-50m need to compensate the workers who arrived in Malaysia 2-3 years ago. Activists wanted TOPG to reimburse the worker immediately - working with HR to reimburse immediately. Activists continue to target TOPG.

Any other issue that could cause the detention? No, only on foreign worker treatment issue. Issue was  foreign workers work more than 7 days a week. Management don’t allowed them to work more than 6 days/week now.  But, foreign workers actually wanted to work longer hours, but TOPG do not allow.

CBP doesn’t require very strong ground to impose detention. CBP look into 2 main areas - 1) Passport retention - TOPG no longer detain foreign worker passports , 2) Recruitment fees - looking into it actively to come up with the calculation to reimburse foreign worker. Has adopted zero recruitment policy since Jan-2019.

Activists tend to rely on consultations. 3rd parties audited TOPG. Engaged with 3rd party independent consultant

The detention list only have 2 TOPG subsidiaries. Impacted 12.5% of TOPG business.  TOPG will continue to ship and park in the free-trade-zone. Detention is 2-4 weeks depending on the settlement (previously WRP is only 2 weeks) and once it is settled the stocks can be released. Customers will complain to the US custom as they demand gloves urgently.

On worse case scenario, can ship to other countries. Will have to return deposit to US customers. Customers not urgent to collect back their deposits because they demand the gloves.

ASP to other countries will be lesser than US but still high. ASP difference between US and non-US? Spot orders ASPs are similar. Normal orders 5% differential.

Could CBP impose bans to other TOPG subsidiaries? Whether they can impose or not is up to CBP.

KUALA LUMPUR (July 16): Top Glove Corp Bhd's share price fell below RM20 in afternoon trades today after it confirmed the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) had yesterday placed a detention order on disposable gloves manufactured by two of its subsidiaries, namely Top Glove Sdn Bhd and TG Medical Sdn Bhd.
At 3:31pm, Top Glove's share price fell RM2.l0 or 9.63% to RM19.70 with some 27 million shares traded. Top Glove was Bursa Malaysia's top decliner.
In a statement to Bursa Malaysia today, Top Glove said it is reaching out to the CBP through the glove producer's office in the US besides the company's customers and consultants, to understand the issue better and work towards a speedy resolution on the matter within an estimated two weeks.
Investors sold Top Glove shares today as the news hit market sentiment after they took into account the North America region, comprising Canada and the US, is a crucial market for the company.
The North America region accounted for the largest share or 27% of Top Glove's sales volume during financial year ended Aug 31, 2019 (FY19), according to the company's latest annual report.
For FY19, Top Glove said its rubber glove sales volume in North America rose 20.3% from a year earlier although the quantity sold was not specified.
theedgemarkets.com's telephone call to Top Glove executive director Lim Cheong Guan went unanswered. Lim had also not responded to the news portal's queries via WhatsApp at the time of writing.
At Bursa today, Top Glove's securities trade resumed following a suspension between 2:30pm and 3:30pm in conjunction with the detention order announcement, which appeared on Bursa's website during the exchange's 12:30pm to 2:30pm break.
Prior to the suspension, Top Glove's share price settled down 56 sen or 2.57% at RM21.24 at 12:30pm for a market capitalisation of RM60.74 billion.
The stock saw some 26 million shares traded then.

I am reproducing this message from a telegram group to my blog.
 
 
Based on back-of-envelope calculations using our model, a two week ban to the US will result in a impact on TOPG's revenue and net profit of RM62.7m and Rm12.7m respectively. This is about 0.9% of our FY20 revenue forecast and 0.8% of our FY20 net profit forecast. This is assuming the gloves are not sold elsewhere and is considered a total loss of revenue (this is unlikely the case)

Sensitivity analysis: Every week this ban is enforced, will impact TOPG's revenue and net profit by 0.46% and 0.4% respectively. This is assuming net profit margin stays the same and the gloves are not sold elsewhere.

The Board of Directors of Top Glove wishes to confirm that the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”) has placed a detention order on disposable gloves manufactured by two of the Company’s subsidiaries, namely Top Glove Sdn Bhd and TG Medical Sdn Bhd on 15 July 2020.
  We are reaching out to the CBP through our office in U.S., customers and consultants, to understand the issue better and work towards a speedy resolution of the matter, within an estimated 2 weeks.
  There is a possibility this may be related to foreign labour issues, which we have already resolved, save for one more issue with regard to retrospective payment of recruitment fees by our workers to agents prior to January 2019, without our knowledge.  However, Top Glove has already been bearing all recruitment fees since January 2019 when our Zero Recruitment Fee Policy was implemented. 
  Over the past few months we have been working on this issue which involves extensive tracing, to establish the correct amount to be paid back to our workers, on behalf of the previous agents.  We estimate the total amount to be about RM20 million to RM50 million. 
  We believe it is in the best interests of all parties to come to a solution expeditiously so that our disposal gloves can reach the parties that need it the most, during this COVID-19 time.
  The Company will provide updates upon further developments.
  This announcement is dated 16 July 2020.

KUALA LUMPUR (July 16): Top Glove Corp Bhd reversed its upward trend in the morning amid news that there is an detention order on its disposable gloves at the US customs on July 15.
The list released by the US Customs and Border Protection showed that the status of the detention order on Top Glove Sdn Bhd and TG Medical Sdn Bhd is ""active"" as at July 15.
Top Glove share price dived from the day's high of RM23.50 at around 10am to close at RM21.24, down 56 sen or 2.57% against yesterday's closing of RM21.80.
The trading volume was 25.7 million shares in the morning session.
Credit Suisse — which has raised its target price to RM37 yesterday — in a short note to clients highlighted that for WRP Asia Pacific Sdn Bhd, another glove maker in Malaysia which was previously on the list, the detention order was revoked after evidence of no forced labour condition..
Nonetheless, it commented that the news is likely to dampen the sentiment on Top Glove until the issue is resolved.
WRP was put on the detention list on Sept 30 last year. The detention order was revoked about six months later on March 24 this year.

KUALA LUMPUR (July 15): Hong Leong Investment Bank Bhd (HLIB) raised its earnings forecast and share target prices (TPs) for rubber glove manufacturers Top Glove Corp Bhd, Hartalega Holdings Bhd and Kossan Rubber Industries Bhd on expectation of higher average selling prices (ASPs) for gloves due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
In a note today, HLIB analyst Farah Diyana Kamaludin said the research firm, however, maintained its ""overweight"" call on the rubber glove sector with ""buy"" calls for Top Glove, Hartalega and Kossan shares.
""Maintain 'overweight' on rubber gloves driven by a pandemic-fuelled demand. Market leader Top Glove (TP: RM31.31) is our top pick for the sector, being the largest glove manufacturer globally with vast clientele, readily supporting the increasing demand,"" she said.
""[For Top Glove,] we raise FY20-22 earnings by 24%/33%/8%. Thus, our TP increases to RM31.31 (from RM23.91) based on 33x PE (+1SD) tagged to mid-FY21 EPS.
""We checked in with Hartalega, and was pleased to hear that ASPs has been increasing. As such we take this opportunity to impute higher ASP assumption (circa +6% year-on-year) due to better-than-expected demand. Following that, our FY21-22 earnings increase by 14%/18%, our TP has increased to RM20.12 (from RM17.63) based on 47x PE (+2SD) tagged to FY21 EPS.
""[For Kossan,] with the expectation of further price adjustments in 2H20 and new capacity coming in 2021, we increase our FY20-22 earnings by 28%/41%/17%. Post adjustments, our TP increases to RM16.37 (from RM11.69) based on 31x PE (+2SD) tagged to FY21 EPS,"" she said.
At Bursa Malaysia today, Hartalega's share price fell RM1.22 or 7.18% to RM15.78 at 4:09pm, Top Glove dropped RM1.16 or 5.01% to RM22 while Kossan was 78 sen or 5.78% lower at RM12.72.
Hartalega and Top Glove are KLCI constituents. At 4:14pm, the KLCI fell 7.72 points or 0.48% to 1,591.03.

MARGMA speakers are of the view that the current shortage will be prolonged until 2H21, longer than Macquarie Equities Research (MQ Research) expected. MQ Research maintains Outperform on the sector, with Top Glove (target price: RM30.40) as its top pick.
Event
MARGMA hosted an industry briefing with sell-side analysts and fund managers. The speakers, President of MARGMA Mr Denis Low and Vice President Dr S. Supramaniam, discussed the prospects and challenges of the rubber glove industry. Both speakers pointed out that current shortages are acute and will likely be prolonged until 2H21, which is longer than MQ Research expected. To recap, Macquarie views the shortages lasting until 1H21 with the assumption that a vaccine will be available in 1H21.
Impact
Reaffirmed global demand growth. MARGMA expects COVID-19 to drive global glove demand to grow 20%-25% to a total of 330bn pcs in 2020E, which is in line with Macquarie’s view. Both speakers reaffirmed that the current shortages are acute and will likely to be prolonged until 2H21. MQ Research notes that most of the demand is skewed towards nitrile gloves given that the biggest rubber glove consumer, the United States, prefers to use nitrile gloves due to the fear of Type I latex protein allergies. Hence, this has widened the price difference between nitrile and latex gloves from ~30% to ~60%. This suggests to MQ Research that the company with a higher nitrile mix and more flexible pricing will experience a higher average selling price (ASP) and stronger margin expansion.
View of post-COVID-19 ASP. This has been one of the key concerns of investors. MARGMA thinks the overall ASP will normalise post the pandemic, however, it is unlikely to return to pre-COVID-19 levels given likely higher glove consumption post COVID-19. Historically, with higher glove demand, manufactures have had better negotiating powers with customers. MQ Research calculates every 1% increase in ASP would raise sector earnings by 4%-5%.
Chinese players are unlikely to be a long-term threat to the Malaysia glove industry, MARGMA believes. This topic is also one of the key concerns of investors since Blue Sail and Intco Medical are looking to expand aggressively in the next 3-5 years. MARGMA highlighted that Malaysia still has a better cost advantage in terms of energy and labour costs. They expect natural gas tariffs to drop in 2021 following lower international gas pricing. MQ Research calculates every 5% drop in the natural gas tariff would lift the sector earnings by 2-3%, assuming no cost pass through.
Outlook
MQ Research reiterates its overweight stance on the Malaysia rubber gloves sector as it views gloves as staples within the healthcare industry and COVID-19 driven demand continues to drive sector earnings growth until 1H21E. MQ Research’s top pick is Top Glove (target price: RM30.40) on wider customer exposure and higher capacity additions in 2020-2021.

‘To Be Or Not To Be’ is the question
Hamlet is thinking about life and death, pondering a state of being versus a state of not being – being alive and being dead. ‘To be or not to be’ is followed by ‘that is the question.’ Life is a lack of power, at the mercy of fortune. Death is empowering, allowing the defeat of fortune. To die though, action in life is needed, making the proposition circular and hopeless. And life after death is an unknown, possibly worse than life itself. It is the great question that Hamlet is asking about human existence in general and his own existence in particular – a reflection on whether it’s better to be alive or to be dead.
Since Mr Ooi Teik Bee told all his hundreds of subscribers that he sold all his Supermax shares, many investors have asked me whether they should also sell their holdings or not. My quick answer is “it depends on your trading skill”.
The 3 price charts show that all the 3 glove stocks have shot up about 500% in the last few months and all of them did not go up in a straight line. No stock can go up continuously for whatever reason. After sometime they must pause and drop. However, due to Covid 19, the demand for medical gloves far exceeds supply. As a result, glove price will continue to go up until the pandemic is under control. All the glove manufacturers are making more and more profit which are being reflected on their share prices.
Currently the number of new Covid 19 cases is still spiking with more than 200,000 new cases every day. Many scientists have predicted that the pandemic will not be under control for at least 1 or more years.   
My quick answer: You can sell if you are a smart trader to be able to buy back at cheaper prices during price correction. To be able to make some profit, investors must buy before the price rebounds. Most investors want to wait for the price to drop lower so that they can buy back at cheaper prices. What are they going to do if it rebounds up sharply?
To buy back at higher prices or not to buy back is the question.
Statistics shows there are more losers than winners in the stock market and most short-term traders cannot make much money due to transaction cost. 
Best strategy:
My advice is not to sell because you don’t know when it will rebound. As I said earlier, all glove stocks will continue to go higher and higher until the pandemic is under control. The best strategy is to buy and hold for many more months until you can see some indication that the pandemic is under control and the demand for gloves is reducing.

Topglove share prices when from RM25.16 to RM20.50 in a massive and sharp waterfall of red. By closing, share prices had recovered to RM23.16
I can say, I was taken by surprise. I wasn't looking at the computer screen when the stampede out of Topglove began. I missed most of the rally up, but I did buy more shares. But being an investor, this stampede didn't make sense. I am not aware of any vaccine, and even if a vaccine was produced, doctors and nurses would need gloves to administer the vaccine. My first thought was that Topglove had a major fire, but I dismissed the idea just as quickly as Topglove has over 40 factories. It just didn’t make sense. So after a bit of internet sleuthing... which amounted too checking Google News, I came across this CNA article reproducing a Reuters article.
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/us-covid-19-vaccine-program-to-start-manufacturing-by-late-summer--says-us-official-12929270
  US COVID-19 vaccine program to start manufacturing by late summer, says US official
REUTERS: Drugmakers partnered with the US government are on track to begin actively manufacturing a vaccine for COVID-19 by the end of the summer, a senior administration official said on Monday (Jul 13).
""If you say exactly when will literally the vaccine materials be in production and manufacturing, it is probably four to six weeks away, but we will be actively manufacturing by the end of summer,"" the official, who declined to be identified by name, said.
He added that the administration is already working with companies to equip and outfit manufacturing facilities and acquire raw materials.
The Trump administration has helped finance the development of four COVID-19 vaccines so far though its Operation Warp Speed Program, which aims to produce 300 million vaccine doses by the end of 2021.
The US government has given grants ranging from several hundred million dollars to over US$1 billion to Johnson & Johnson, Moderna Inc, AstraZeneca Plc and Novovax Inc.
  On first glance it appears that the fear of all glove investors has occurred, a vaccine has been developed and is just a month away from mass production. The party was over, last one out turns off the light. But if you look at the article closer you realize something very strange is happening. Firstly the existence of a highly coveted COvid19 vaccine was being announced by a senior administrator that did not want to be name. And who had developed this vaccine? Who is making it? Rather than just name whose who, the article diverts to a world salad, about how much the Trump administration has funded research into Covid19 vaccine development. Okay a useless fact that maybe a Trump lie, and it side steps the question of who. A careless reader might be misled to think the list of companies getting government grants had developed the vaccine that they were talking about. But that is wrong.
As for the vaccine, it is pretty much public knowledge which companies are making serious attempts to develope a vaccine.and at what stage they are in relative to clinical trials. Companies are not exactly shy about informing the public as news, even news without scientific merit has a positive impact on their stock prices. So how could the US develop a vaccine without anyone knowing about it. More so without any news about the various phases the vaccine has to go through. A phase I trial has a dozen people. A phase II trial has hundreds of people and a Phase III trial has thousands, even ten thousand of volunteers.  So why no data? We don’t see it even from the NIH,  which would be keeping track of all these clinical trials within the US.
And of course the time. This is July 14 2020. The US didn’t really start vaccine development until late March (at the earliest). You cannot get a vaccine developed, made and tested in 4 months. Think about this, you need to make a vaccine against an unknown virus that nobody has seen before, conduct at least 2 human trials (normally 3) that involves hundreds to thousands of people (Which you must find and gather together), with one trial normally requiring 1 year to conduct, in just under 4 months. This is not happening unless, you skipped the human trials and are going to inject the first compound that gave a ferret some short term resistance to SARS-Cov2 and called it a day. He// it took time to find out which animal could be infected by SARS-Cov2 virus to do animal test on… It is monkeys, cats and ferrets by the way.
This white house vaccine is an impossibility . I will say it right now. There is no vaccine. Much less a vaccine that is ready to be manufactured. So why this article?
I suspect this ‘news’ was officially leaked by Trump administration to fill the news media with the rumour of a US vaccine that is just around the corner. Trump will just say it up to the doctors, but he is very glad about it. Nice photo op.  The purpose here is to shift attention away from how bad the Covid19 pandemic in the US has become. We have US counties that are 2 weeks away from running out of PPE (gloves, mask, face shields), and ICU units in several major cities have reach capacity (not difficult given some regions in the US have 1 ICU bed for every 10,000 people). In some hospitals, 40% of their patients are Covid19 cases. The virus is now threatening to cause states to reclose. And in the state of Mississippi , many of their politicians have contracted Covid19... A case of Republicans beliving their own BS.
This rumour of a Covid19 vaccine would distract the news cycle for a few days, maybe even a week as reporters try to find out more about this secret vaccine. Perhaps even sparking debates on who should get it first. And if they can get Joe Biden to enter this trap and voice his opinion, it will distract the media and people some more. Time for Trump to sneak away and reformulate a new campaign strategy to win the US November 3 elections."

Glove demand likely to sustain in 2021 backed by unabated Covid-19 and fears of second wave, supporting higher ASP until 1H2021.
Top Glove order lead time lengthening further to c.16 months and ASP for Aug rose 30% mom (previous guidance 10%).
We revised our FY20/FY21 earnings by +49%/+158% and maintain BUY with higher TP of RM31.30. This is based on 23x PER pegged on FY21 EPS of 136 sen.
Demand visibility to be sustained in 2021.
Gloves demand is anticipated to be sustained in 2021 due to unabated worldwide spread of Covid-19 with some countries yet to reach peak infections (eg: US, Brazil, India) and risks of second wave (e.g: China, South Korea, UK, Australia), on the assumption that mass vaccine production will not be available at least until mid-2021. We gather that Top Glove’s average order lead time has increased further to c.16 months (from previous month guidance of c.12 months) with Nitrile gloves have the longest order lead time (chart 2). Top Glove has the greatest extra capacity compared to its peers to take advantage of robust demand. Management targets capacity of 86.1bn pcs by end 2020 (+c.21% yoy) and 100.4bn pcs by end 2021 (+16% yoy) (refer table 2). We are assuming utilisation rate of more than 95%/90% for FY20/21.
ASP continues to trend upwards.
Management guided that ASP for June and July had increased by 15% mom with Aug ASP increasing further to 30% (previous guidance c.10%) on the back of booming demand. Additionally, there is an increase of ad hoc/spot orders especially from North America, West Europe and Asia due to the ongoing spike in cases and second wave of Covid-19. Ad-hoc order price is about 3-4x higher than normal prices (ad-hoc price c.USD90- 120/1000 pcs) which currently accounts for 20% of total capacity allocation (previously c.10%). We believe Top Glove has a better pricing power compared to its peers due to their diverse customer base. Moreover, it is the biggest OEM player in the sector c.26% global market share and hence, could be a sector leader in ASP hikes. Overall, we now forecast that higher ASPs could be sustained until 1H2021 before gradually decreasing in 2H2021 and gravitate to normal level in 2022.
Long term prospect still promising.
Long term demand post Covid-19 remains positive (>+ 10% p.a) on greater hygiene awareness, as well as greater structural global change in gloves usage for non-medical sector such as services industries. In catering for growing global demand, Top Glove continues to expand through organic growth by building about 2 factories every year and seeking for viable M&A opportunities. Additionally, ongoing efforts of embarking on digitalisation and automation will help reduce a reliance on foreign labour and improve the efficiency of its manufacturing process in the long term

Market Review
Malaysia: The FBM KLCI (+0.9%) started off the week on a buoyant manner after lingering in the positive territory for the entire trading session yesterday, mainly boosted by the extended gains in glove heavyweights. The lower liners also marched higher. Although the broader market finished mostly lower, the healthcare (+4.3%) continues to outperform, rising for the eleventh straight session.
Global markets: US stockmarkets finished mixed after shaving off their intraday gains; the Dow rose 0.04%, but the S&P 500 fell 0.9% on the back of concern over the prospects of re-opening of economy. European stockmarkets marched higher, while Asia stockmarkets staged a swift recovery from last Friday pullback.
The Day Ahead
Investors will digest the barrage of corporate earnings releases from US, of which analysts are predicting -44.6% YoY in earnings contraction in 2QFY20. Back home, rotational play will continue amongst the lower liners, while the extended rise on glove heavyweight shares will continue to anchor the performance on the local bourse. At the same time, investors will be keeping an eye on Malaysia’s unemployment rate for May 2020, after record high at 5.0% registered in April 2020.
Sector focus: While the healthcare sector will continue to be in favour, we think that the technology sector may also edge higher as companies around the world embarks on digital transformation and automation.
The FBM KLCI has gapped up to close the 1,600 psychological level as the key index has formed another bullish candle yesterday. Following the breakthrough above the aforementioned level, we expect the upward momentum to continue as the key index looks to re-test the immediate resistance at 1,615 over the foreseeable future, followed by 1640. Downside risk is now pegged at 1,570, followed by 1,550. Indicators are still positive as the MACD Histogram has extended another green bar, but the RSI remains overbought.

Is it a good idea to enter now? price is quite high now
  Earlier would have been better. But that is hindsight

Before joining this counter, note the volatility.

Today (13 July 2020) we went from 22.94 to 24.5 then down to 23.50 before ending the day at 24.

There was also a month where we started at 17.2, hit 18.00 when TG announced a 350+% increase in profits then despite the good news dropped all the way to RM 14, before climbing back to RM15.5. During that month we had people saying that TG bull run had ended, that it was over priced. Sell! Sell! Vaccine was coming. And all the while the number of Covid19 cases continued to rise. IB gave out TP ranging from RM21-25.

One month of that before TG started to climb again, reaching 24.

So, if you do buy into TG, please understand the fundamental reason why TG and all other glove counters is going up. It is the covid19 virus. As long as the virus continues to spread, the need for gloves remains. You need to know this to have confidence in the stock.So rather than seeing share prices fall from RM17 to RM14 as the most terrible nightmare inducing experience, you see it as a second chance to buy more shares.

TG has a very high profile now, so expect lots of volatility as institutional investors move in and move out. The waves they make by their movements are huge. And institutional investors make their commission when they trade. So they won't buy and sit quietly until the end of 2021. In and out. Big waves.

You must also be able to hold your shares. This pandemic will last some time so in the long term share prices will rise but in the short term you may see all kinds of behavior. If you don't have holding power, you may  be forced to sell at a bad time. But at the same time have a plan to leave. Covdi19 pandemic will not last forever. Even this too will pass.

Price is high now. But when I first entered at around RM4-5, RM6 was high, then RM10 was high, RM16 was high, RM 20 was high. Now RM24 is high. Every day will always be high because TG shares are climbing in price. Share prices appears low, when it is falling like a rock (ie Airasia). And you don't want to be joining a rock in free fall. It is a really terrible experience.

As for being a good idea or not to enter, you will need to decide if you are trader or an investor.

An investor is looking for good companies that are selling at or below their fair price. So you need to value Topglove and determine if RM24 is fair price for TG shares. Is there more value in the shares? For an investor, a share with a high cost does not mean it is expensive and neither does low cost share mean it is cheap. Garbage can be both a cheap rotting fish and an expensive broken airplane.

If you are a trader. Cost of the share does not matter. Company fundamentals does not matter. It doesn't even matter if the share prices go up, down or sideways. All that matters is can you predict what the price of the share will be within a certain time frame and implement the appropriate trading strategy? Can you see where TG share prices will go? If you can, go for it, if you can't don't.

Final rule, we are all here to make money. Super serious. The Forum here is to share our opinion on the best way to make money. We are all confident that our opinion is the right one. But then you have people who say sell, others say buy. Both can't be right, somebody is wrong. Who, we don't know. You have to decide what your opinion is, whether you are an investor or trader.
 
Me, I think the glove counters will continue to climb as long as the SARS-Cov2 virus remains uncontrolled. It is my opinion that a vaccine will not be ready in 2020. At best late 2021. TG can run wild until a vaccine is found. I am investing in Topglove because I see this pandemic as transformative for this company. It will fill TG with so much cash, pay for the expansion of its production capacity and improve its brand recognition to the point that TG will do what other companies that become big do, grow by buy out smaller glove companies. I see TG consolidating the glove business. It is already the bigger glove manufecturer than the other 3 of the Big 4 combined.

KUALA LUMPUR (July 13): Top Glove Corp Bhd, the world’s largest glove maker, is set to build two factories every year to keep pace with global demand for rubber gloves amid increased usage in the medical industry and heightened hygiene awareness among people due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
According to chairman Tan Sri Lim Wee Chai, it currently has 45 factories, of which 34 are glove factories with 700 production lines that have the capacity to make a total of 78.7 billion pieces of gloves per annum.
The rest are two latex concentrate plants, three chemical factories, a glove former (mould) factory, two packaging material factories, a dental dam factory, a condom factory and a face mask factory.
Of the 45 factories, 40 are located in Malaysia, four in Thailand and one in China. A new factory is being set up in Vietnam, which is expected to come on stream in September, he said.
""We will continue to build about two factories every year to ensure we are well positioned to cater to the growing global glove demand,"" he told Bernama in an exclusive interview.
He said Top Glove also remains open to mergers and acquisitions (M&A), joint ventures and diversification opportunities.
“We expand during the good times and prepare for rainy days. The glove industry is an international business and there is competition. Survival in the business is like participating in the Olympics; you need to remain fit to compete or you will be phased out.”
As for demand, Lim said pre-Covid-19 global glove demand was growing 8% to 10% per annum, driven by strong market fundamentals across geographies.
For 2020, Top Glove foresees a 25% growth.
""Before Covid-19, we were running at about 85% capacity. Now we are running at close to 100%,” he said. Countries globally need more gloves now than before the pandemic; hence, proper planning and allocation is of utmost priority.
For instance, he said, regular customers are getting 10% extra gloves to ensure a continuous supply of the requested rubber gloves so that gloves are available in every country. While the company also sells to new customers, they are offered a spot price, which is usually higher than the regular price.
“In 2021 and post Covid-19, the rubber glove industry is expected to post an annual growth of between 12% and 15% on the back of increased usage in both the medical and non-medical sectors, as well as heightened hygiene awareness arising from the pandemic,” he said.
Currently, 20% of the world’s population, namely the US, European Union (EU) and Japan, account for 70% of glove usage, while the other 80% only use 30% of the gloves produced globally, which means there is an abundance of opportunities, Lim said.
He noted that gloves are an essential item in the healthcare sector, serving as a protective barrier for medical staff, with increasing demand in developing markets on the back of growing hygiene awareness.
Hence, glove demand is expected to grow both in developing countries where glove usage is relatively low as well as in developed countries, where glove usage has expanded beyond healthcare to other sectors such as food and beverages.
Going forward, Lim said Top Glove remains on track to achieve its ambitious goal to become a Fortune Global 500 company by 2040 by pursuing a bigger share of the international glove market. 
""We are proud to become the world's largest manufacturer of nitrile gloves, in addition to natural rubber gloves and surgical gloves,"" he said, adding that to be in the Fortune Global 500 list, it would have to grow by 30 times to achieve US$35 billion (RM150 billion) sales revenue.
He said Top Glove would be investing more in technology, research and development (R&D) as well as artificial and human intelligence in its effort to achieve the goal. 
As at July 6, Top Glove was ranked the sixth-largest company on Bursa Malaysia and the 10th largest on the Singapore Exchange (SGX) in terms of market capitalisation, placing it among the elite top 10 companies on both bourses. 
Its share price had surged 421% to close at RM21.92 last Friday, compared with RM4.20 on Jan 2, 2020.
In a filing with Bursa Malaysia on Saturday, Top Glove said its net profit skyrocketed by 365.9% to an all-time high of RM347.9 million for the third quarter ended May 31, 2020, versus RM74.67 million for the same period last year, with revenue jumping 42% to RM1.69 billion from RM1.19 billion previously. 
It attributed the extraordinary performance to unparalleled growth in sales volume on the back of the Covid-19 pandemic.
Following a meteoric rise in its monthly sales orders, it said its lead time had increased from 40 days to around 400 days, whereby orders placed now would only be delivered over a year later. 
Top Glove had a humble beginning as a local business enterprise with a single factory and one glove production line in 1991.
Today, it has captured 26% of the world market share and offers a comprehensive product range, fulfilling demand in both the healthcare and non-healthcare segments. The company serves a growing network of over 2,000 customers in more than 190 countries.

Contrary to our earlier assumptions, the industry ASPs have risen even further month on-month in anticipation of tighter supply and supernormal demand due to the pandemic. Management has guided that Aug ASP is 30% higher M-o-M instead of earlier guidance of +10%. This prompts us to raise our FY20E/FY21E ASP assumptions. Hence, we raise our FY20E/FY21E net profit by 16%/120%. TP is raised from RM25.00 to RM32.00 based on 21.5x CY21E EPS. Reiterate Outperform.
ASPs in Aug higher than earlier guidance. We came away from a meeting with management feeling optimistic on prospects over the next few quarters fuelled by sustained high ASP. Contrary to our earlier assumptions, the industry ASP has risen further month-on-month in anticipation of tighter supply and supernormal demand due to the pandemic. Management has guided that Aug ASP is +30% higher m-o-m which exceeds the earlier guidance of +10%. Recall that previously, we highlight that TOPGLOV’s ASP for months of June to Aug was higher by between 5% to 15%, due to continuous supply tightness. Additionally, we understand that spot price is expected to move up starting from September 2020. Presently, spot price is about 3x the normal prices of USD28-30/1000 pieces which accounts for 20% of total capacity allocation. With a diverse customer base, we expect TOPLGOV to have better pricing power and hence potentially higher-than-expected industry average prices. Due to the tight supply, we expect buyers to jockey for position in order to secure allocation which will push up ASPs. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) of which glove is one of the components is presently much sought after due to limited supply. Longer delivery lead times are indicating that demand will outstrip supply at least over the medium-term. The robust demand has led to longer delivery lead times which has risen to >400-500 days from 80 to 100 days two months ago.
Raised FY20E/FY21E net profit by 16%/120% after i) hiking our ASP from USD32/USD33/1000 pieces to USD32//USD40/1000 pieces for FY20E/FY21E, and ii) raise FY21E volume sales growth from 28% to 40%.
Reiterate OP. TP is raised from RM25.00 to RM32.00 based on 21.5x CY21E EPS of 152.3 sen (previously 36x) (at +0.5 SD above 5-year historical forward mean). We lowered our PER rating as we believe valuations are pegged to supernormal earnings; hence, upside to peak earnings should have been factored in. Its merits are: (i) strong management, (ii) resilient earnings base due to its pricing power and its sheer size in capacity in the industry, and (iii) solid earnings growth averaging >100% in FY21 compared to PERs of 15x.
A key risk to our call is lower-than-expected volume sales and ASP

KUALA LUMPUR (July 12): The Covid-19 pandemic is still raging outside Malaysia’s borders, which caused an increased demand for rubber gloves — something the world’s largest glove company is only too happy to meet, except that they are currently short of workers.
Malaysia imposed travel restrictions into the country beginning in March with the Movement Control Order (MCO) in a bid to contain Covid-19.
While the restrictions have been eased as the number of cases dropped, the government recently announced it was suspending the intake of new foreign workers till the end of the year, while encouraging companies to hire more Malaysians.
But Top Glove chairman and founder, Tan Sri Lim Wee Chai, told Bernama that expecting only locals to fill the vacancies was unrealistic, and would reduce Malaysia’s competitiveness.
He said they had hired 2,500 local staff and workers last year, which form part of the company’s 19,000-strong workforce globally.
Despite their recruitment efforts, the current workforce was not sufficient to meet the demand for gloves, which has increased dramatically due to Covid-19.
“Before Covid-19, we were running (at) about 80% to 85% capacity. Now we are running more than 100%. Though we add in new capacity, we are still not able to cope with the demand; the demand is just too strong,” he said. 
“So we hope the government will open up (the recruitment process) so that we can reduce the shortage of workers. So hopefully, by Sept 1, after the MCO is over.”
According to the company, the lead time to fulfil orders for gloves was now more than a year — which means if someone ordered gloves today, it would take over a year before the shipment arrives at its destination. Prior to the pandemic, the lead time was between 10 to 60 days.
Bernama contacted the Human Resource Ministry for comment but did not immediately get a response.
Andy Hall, an independent British migrant worker and labour rights activist, was unsurprised the company was asking the government to allow more foreign workers in.
“It’s hard work in a hot and sticky environment, so not many locals want to work there. Locals come for a short while and leave. (Foreign workers) are willing to work harder for less money and it’s not a good thing,” he said. 
“If they want more workers, great; but give more incentives and protections,” he added.
Top Glove has been the subject of several news reports alleging labour rights violations, including a recent one by Channel 4, a TV news channel in the United Kingdom, accusing the company of excessive overtime, illegal salary deductions and unethical recruitment practices among others. The company characterised the Channel 4 report as “highly inaccurate.” Other rubber glove companies in Malaysia have faced similar scrutiny.
When asked, Lim acknowledged the company had made some mistakes and said the company rectified them as best as they could.
He added that workers take home at least RM1,600, which is above the minimum wage in Malaysia, are compensated according to time worked and seniority, and in accordance with local labour laws. The company also provides free healthcare and subsidised meals to their staff and workers.
Hall agreed the company had made some progress in addressing some of the concerns, but said there were still many areas that need fixing.
“Their social compliance is getting better,” he said, citing the company’s announcement they will be reimbursing their workers’ recruitment fees as an example. “The pressure is working.”
According to news reports, Top Glove has been investing billions of ringgit in automation to address the shortage of foreign workers. This expansion is expected to add 42 production lines to its present 700 by the end of the year. However, it is unlikely to be enough to speed up the delivery time to their customers for now. 
Top Glove rubber, latex and nitrile gloves are used in the healthcare, food and beverage, and sanitisation industries. The company also produces face masks, condoms, exercise bands, toothpaste and other healthcare or health-oriented products. According to the company, its market share is 26 per cent, and Top Glove has an annual capacity of 78.7 billion gloves.
Due to heightened demand for personal protective equipment (PPE), which includes gloves, amid the coronavirus pandemic, the company recorded a profit of RM575 million by May. In January, before the start of the pandemic, Top Glove was trading at just below RM5 on Bursa Malaysia, but has since jumped to above RM20.
Record profits have also lifted Lim’s net worth from US$1.2 billion to US$4.4 billion, making him the 1,613th billionaire on the Forbes Billionaire Index.

Rally of the sector is sustainable as underpinned by resilient US demand in relation to ‘Obamacare’. We envisage prolonged upcycle of the rubber glove sector as empirical evidence suggests that glove manufactures are set to benefit from healthcare spending expansion by the U.S pursuant to comeback of Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) or “Obamacare” in colloquial term on the back of high chances of winning by Democratic Party’ s Joe Biden.
Comment
Joe Biden is expected to clinch landslide victory in upcoming US presidential election. Joe Biden is likely to outrun Donald Trump in the U.S presidential election to be held in November 2020 according to The Economist forecasting model (Figure 1). The model indicates Joe Biden has 89% chance of winning the Electoral College, 98% chance of winning the most votes, and 241 predicted range of Electoral College votes (270 to win). Battered economic condition, record cases of COVID- 19, and “Black lives matter” protest heavily dampen Trump’s approval rating in the nascent months. Also, there are small odds of vaccine discovery and strong economy recovery in the U.S before November poll.
What is Joe Biden thinking? He is planning to build on the Affordable Care Act by giving Americans more choices, reducing health care costs, and making the health care system less complex to navigate. We have captured few salient points of Joe Biden’s visions on healthcare such as “Giving Americans a new choice, a public health insurance option like Medicare”, “Increasing the value of tax credits to lower premiums and extend coverage to more working Americans”, and “Expanding coverage to low-income Americans”. Hence, we expect an upscale of healthcare plan and budget on the way after he becomes the U.S president.
Democrat tends to work on healthcare structural reform. History tells us that Democratic Party has always been mover of the country’s healthcare reform where we have seen a slew of healthcare acts have been launched such as Medicare Bill, Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and PPACA. Healthcare benefits of the U.S citizen has always been assured by Democratic Party in the U.S history.
Expansion of insurance coverage. The healthcare sector underwent a structural reform upon former president Barack Obama launched PPACA in 2010. The motive of PPACA is to create fairer health coverage and less complicated, along with subsidies to make it more affordable and expand to the Medicaid program to cover more people with low incomes. As a result, in 2016, the number of Americans not covered by health insurance fell from 44 million to 27 million – an almost 40% drop. Moreover, public and private health insurance accounted for 41% and 34% respectively in total national healthcare expenditures in 2018 rather than 22% and 21% in 1970 (Figure 2).
Surge in the U.S’ total national healthcare expenditures (TNH) with the enforcement of PPACA. PPACA came into force in 2014 after signing in 2010. TNH grew consecutively in 2014, 2015, and 2016 (+5.2%, +5.8%, and 4.6% YoY respectively) (Figure 3) as more people were protected by the insurance scheme. In addition, “other non-durable medical products expenditures” growth had been trending upwards since 2010 but the growth slumped to 2.2% in 2017 (Figure 4) after Trump repealed PPACA. The changes made by Trump including reduction in the penalty for not having insurance to zero amount, federal government was no longer reimbursing subsidiaries to low-income group for applying insurance, and significantly cutting federal funding for these programs.
The U.S was the highest gloves importer. The U.S imported USD2.3b value of gloves which was 2.2x of the world’s second largest importer, European Union which amounted to USD1.06b in 2019 (Figure 5). The U.S healthcare spending was top in 2018 globally where the healthcare expenditure counted 16.9% of GDP, far outpacing 2nd position of 11.2% of GDP (Figure 6). Meanwhile, the U.S also ranked 2nd in gloves per capita consumption (pieces) in 2018. We think the U.S will keep its leading position in the coming years which is in tandem with the country’s budget expansion in healthcare as more people will get covered by insurance.
Malaysia glove manufactures leading in global market. Malaysia glove manufactures commanded 63.5% market share of global gloves in 2019, following by Thailand (15.5%) and Indonesia (4.3%) (Figure 9). Leading manufactures with high exposures to North America markets such as Hartalega (55.0%), Topglove (27% est.), Supermax (50%) and Comfort glove (52%) are going to benefit from ramp up of healthcare spending by the U.S. Moreover, we deem Malaysia will continue to dominate in global glove market as Joe Biden has no intention to compromise with China in trade related and HK’s national security law issues any time soon, besides Malaysia enjoying relatively low tariffs as compared to China as well as long-renowned superior quality of rubber gloves. This will only strengthen local glove makers’ footprints in the U.S.
Strong correlation between the U.S healthcare expansion and Malaysia glove sales. ‘Other non-durable medical products’ expenditures had strong positive relationship with Malaysia’s gloves export to the U.S from 2010 to 2018 with R2=0.883 (Figure 10), showing a strong correlation between the 2 factors. Notably, aggregate revenue of Hartalega, Topglove, Supermax, and Comfort glove to North America recorded a double-digit growth from 2015 to 2018 (Figure 11) as well as CAGR of 18.14% during the period rather than uneven growths the years before 2015, which is in line with the aforementioned PPACA came into force in 2014.
Valuation & Recommendation:
Maintain overweight as we expect another strong growth cycle is brewing underpinned by the resumption of Obamacare besides the coronavirus pandemic effect. Thus, we maintain our existing BUY call on Topglove with a higher target price of RM25.40 (Previous TP: RM22.41) and upgrade Hartalega to BUY with a revised target price of RM18.80 (which is pegged at 51x which +1 S.D of 5-year mean; Previous TP: RM9.10).
We upgrade our earnings forecasts for FY21 and FY22 on Hartalega by 117% and 121.4% to RM1248m (+187% YoY) and RM1158.6m (-7.2% YoY) respectively in view of better ASP and utilization rate. Also, we introduce our FY23 net earnings forecast of RM993m.
Likewise, we also upgrade our FY20, FY21, and FY22 net earnings forecasts for Topglove by 31.6%, 20.9%, and 61.1% to RM1305.7m, RM2717.5m, and RM1457.4m respectively in respect of better ASP and utilization rate pursuant to acceleration of COVID-19 cases globally.

Rubber glove stocks under our coverage have performed well following our upgrade eight months ago. Despite easing off from recent peaks, they remain strong outperformers YTD, led by SUPERMX (+643%), TOPGLOV (+329%), HARTA (+204%) and KOSSAN (+158%). Based on our analysis in this report, we can conclude that: (i) ASP is going to be stubbornly high at least till 1H 2021 which supports exponential QoQ earnings growth over the next few quarters, (ii) share prices of rubber glove stocks moves upwards ahead of two quarters of good results, (iii) gloves stocks trade at +2.0SD based on historical upcycle. All in, we are excited with prospects over the next few quarters due to supply tightness and strong demand. Specifically, industry trend of rising weekly and monthly ASPs is expected to boost bottom-lines. Amplifying the growth are restocking and inventory-building activities creating a supernormal demand spurt leading to acute supply shortage, due to the prolonged pandemic. We have OUTPERFORM calls on HARTA (OP; TP: RM18.16); KOSSAN (OP; TP: RM14.00) SUPERMX (OP; TP: RM14.00) and TOPGLOV (OP; TP: RM25.00). Our Top Pick for the sector is TOPGLOV (OP; TP: RM25.00) due to its ability to raise ASP, and commanding the largest industry capacity.
Based on historical valuation on rapidly rising earnings, rubber glove stocks should trade >+2.0SD. We believe rubber glove stocks deserve further multiple PER re-rating and should trade at above previous peak PER valuations of +2.0SD in tandem with exponential QoQ earnings growth and higher double-digit YoY growth in coming quarters given the following factors:- (i) ASP upticks over the next few months indicating that consensus earnings is potentially trailing, and (ii) re-stocking activities ramp-up as the current outbreak of the pandemic enforces higher hygiene standards, (iii) higher demand due to the pandemic, stock piling and new users following the pandemic, and (iv) massive margins expansion due to higher ASPs.
ASPs higher than earlier guidance. We highlight that industry ASPs for months of June to Dec 2020 is now higher by between 5% to 15%, as opposed to previous expectation of +5% monthly increase from June to Sep 2020 indicating that supply tightness has further propelled ASP higher.
Estimated incoming capacity indicating demand > supply further boost ASP. We have done an analysis to quash any concerns of oversupply. In anticipation of higher demand due to the pandemic, stock piling and new users following the pandemic, players are raising capacities to meet the surging demand. Our analysis (see table overleaf) suggests that acute supply and supernormal demand could persist over the next two years. Interestingly, players are getting orders for new users that include airlines, restaurants, retail apparel chains and hotel operators. If we look at the capacity expansion numbers in isolation, it looks overwhelming. Juxtaposed against the annual demand growth and new pandemic-led demand, the additional capacity is not a concern.
Consensus upgraded earnings by 50%-300% over the past five months. Standing testimony to the increasingly strong prospects of the sector, analysts surveyed by Blomberg Consensus have over the last 5 months consistently upgraded the earnings forecasts for glove players our coverage players such as TOPGLOV, KOSSAN, HARTALEGA and SUPERMX.
Nitrile gloves' market share to gain further momentum with potential 30% growth. Based on our analysis, we expect nitrile gloves to continue growing and expropriating market share from latex gloves. The growth in nitrile segment is evident. For illustration purposes, going forward, assuming nitrile:latex breakdown of 80:20 (currently at 67:37) and based on estimated global demand of 324b pieces in 2020 (forecast for 2019 is 300b pieces and assuming 8% growth rate in 2020), this implies nitrile growth rate of 20% or an additional 42b pieces from switching to nitrile gloves.
TOPGLOV (OP; TP; RM25.00). We highlight that TOPGLOV’s ASPs for months of June to Aug is now higher by between 5% to 15%, as opposed to earlier guidance of +5%, indicating that supply tightness have further propelled ASP higher. However, spot price is about 3x the normal prices of USD28-30/1,000 pieces which accounts for 5%-10% of total allocation. With a diverse customer base, we expect TOPLGOV to have better pricing power and hence potentially higher-than-expected industry average prices.
SUPERMAX (OP; TP; RM14.00). The group is confident of raising ASP by between 5% to 10% each month from June till Dec 2020 indicating that supply tightness have further propelled ASP higher. Specifically, Supermax is expected to gain from higher margins from both its gloves manufacturing and distribution divisions due to higher product mix skewed towards OBM distribution which accounts for 95% compared to 70% pre Covid-19

While MQ Research does not anticipate an immediate threat from Chinese players, it sees a potential glove oversupply risk in 2022.  Given the higher average selling price (ASP), MQ Research upgraded Hartalega to Outperform with an increased target price of RM17.00 while reiterating an Outperform rating on Top Glove with TP of RM30.40.
Impact
Strong demand to continue in 2021. Common questions that MQ Research has received are “how strong is the current demand?” and “how long can this strong demand last?” Manufacturers are now pointing to lengthening lead times, robust order conversion and an increase in spot order enquiries. This indicates to MQ Research that the sector has not seen peak glove demand yet. In addition, MQ Research is keeping an eye on the swine flu in China and the upcoming flu season in the United States where peaks are usually between Dec and Feb. This should support overall glove demand until 1H21 and only gradually normalise in 2H21, having assumed a vaccine is available in mid-2021.
Ambitious expansion plans from Chinese players does not change MQ Research’s investment thesis.  MQ Research factors in Blue Sail and Intco Medical expansion plans for the next three years in MQ Research’s demand-supply assumptions. MQ Research does not foresee an immediate threat from Chinese players as i) most capacities will only gradually commence in late-2Q21 and ii) new capacity will be rolled out on a staggered basis. MQ Research sees there is a potential oversupply risk in 2022 with 12bn pcs of surplus. Having said that MQ Research thinks this concern can be easily eased with the deferment of expansion plans (which MQ Research has seen in the past) or absorption from higher China domestic consumption.
MQ Research views on the ASP trend. In MQ Research’s base case assumption, MQ Research expects manufacturers to continue to have pricing power to raise/maintain the high average selling price (ASP) until June-21, and thereafter MQ Research expects it will take six months to return to pre-COVID-19 levels. MQ Research projects global demand will normalise gradually when we have a vaccine. The vaccine is likely to take stages to commercialise globally.
Key downside risks are demand growth and the ASP trend. Key to watch is vaccine progress. A virus shot from Pfizer and BioNtech showed promising results in early testing, and looks to be on track to have the first shot in early 2021. Dr Anthony Fauci is also hopeful for a COVID-19 vaccine by early-2021. MQ Research’s bear case valuations for Top Glove and Hartalega are RM11.80 and RM8.60.
Outlook
Given that gloves are staples within the healthcare industry and MQ Research expects continued shortages in 2021, MQ Research projects strong earnings growth to continue in 2021E. In view of the recent, more aggressive ASP increases by manufacturers, MQ Research expects Top Glove’s FY21E to deliver about three times that of its FY20E. With strong earnings, MQ Research reiterates an Outperform rating on Top Glove with an increased target price (TP) of RM30.40. MQ Research also upgrades Hartalega from Neutral to OP with an increased TP of RM17.00 given the higher ASP increase than MQ Research expected. MQ Research’s FY21E forecasts for Top Glove and Hartalega are >100% and 78% above consensus.

KUALA LUMPUR (July 7): RHB Investment Bank Bhd Research (RHB Research) has maintained its ""buy"" call for Top Glove Corp Bhd with a higher target price (TP) of RM24.80 a share premised on increasing demand and a tight inventory level.
In a research note today, the research house said it raised its earnings estimates and TP due to higher average selling prices (ASPs).
""This premium is justified due to Top Glove’s status as the world’s biggest glove producer and its ability to raise ASPs more than its peers.
""We expect glove demand to surge in the US. Demand should continue to rise throughout the third quarter this year as Covid-19 is still spreading,"" it said.
In 2019, the US consumed an estimated 92.7 billion pieces of gloves per annum — equivalent to 35% of global demand — making it the world's biggest glove consumer.
RHB Research said glove inventory was estimated to be extremely low at 11 billion pieces or less than half a month’s supply.
It said the increase in ASP assumptions was based on a shortage of certain raw materials used to manufacture gloves, which had capped near-term supply.
""We increased our financial year 2020 to 2022 ASP assumptions by 1% to 4% and earnings forecasts by 4% to 18%,"" it said.
For the fourth quarter this year, core earnings should also show a significant improvement quarter-on-quarter as ASPs are on an increasing trend, it said.
RHB Research added that post Covid-19, Top Glove’s earnings growth outlook remains positive as glove demand is expected to continue its uptrend of an 8% to 10% growth on higher hygiene awareness globally. 
As at 10.35am, Top Glove was 46 sen higher at RM20.42, with 6.83 million shares traded.

We are keeping our OVERWEIGHT call on the glove sector. We believe that selling prices will continue to soar in the next 6 months as lead time stretches up to 12 months. The glove companies’ earnings will be further boosted by expanded margins as raw material prices remain low, selling prices continue to grow, USD continues to strengthen over the MYR and expansion plans remain intact for the glove producers.
In terms of demand, we expect sales volume and average selling price (ASP) to grow exponentially in 2H2020 in light of the Covid-19 pandemic. The higher demand has resulted in a shortage of supply, pushing up average selling prices for these medical gloves. ASPs are trending upwards and glovemakers now guide for around 5–15% QoQ gradual increases while spot selling prices for gloves skyrocketed 100–400% in the past few months as panic buying of gloves ensues.
Total rubber glove export value from Malaysia grew 21.4% YoY to RM6,868bil in Jan–April 2020. We think that the trend will continue well into 2021 until a Covid-19 vaccine is available to the masses. In the meantime, usage of rubber gloves will remain a priority not only in the medical sector but across various industries.
Beyond the Covid-19 pandemic, we anticipate a structural change in the way gloves are used, forming a new normal where glove usage per capita will increase as hygiene measures become stricter. This is expected to apply not only in the healthcare sector but also across different industries like F&B. The glove consumption per capita in emerging markets such as India and China is low at around 2–6 gloves as opposed to circa 100–280 gloves for developed countries
Having said that, we think that rubber glove’s ASP will face a downward pressure in year 2022F (assuming full containment of Covid-19) due to lower urgency of orders with higher supply of gloves from expanded capacity. As shown in Exhibit 1, the big glove producers (Top Glove, Kossan, Hartalega, Supermax and Sri Trang) have plans to increase capacity by 16% in 2020E, 11% in 2021F and 10% in 2022F. This will add 74.6bil pieces (+40%) of capacity by end-2022. Although this bodes well in terms of ability to cater to higher volume of orders for the next 1–1.5 years we think that short-term supply glut will come back into play in 2022F.
Our house projection for the USD/MYR rate is an average of RM4.29 in 2020 and RM4.25 in 2021. We think that a stronger USD will even help further expand net margins for glove companies because unlike pre-Covid-19 times, cost savings are not passed through to customers due to supply constraints.
We are raising our ASP assumptions for Top Glove, Kossan and Hartalega in light of the recent spike in Covid-19 cases across the globe. We think that glove ASP will continue to grow in 2H2020 and be sustained even in 1H2021 as lead time continues to hover at 12 months. The changes to earnings forecasts are shown in Exhibits 7–9.
We maintain our BUY call on Top Glove with a higher FV of RM26.00/share. Our valuation is based on 33x CY21F EPS. We assume an FY21F ASP of US$35 (previously US$29) as we believe the higher selling prices will sustain for another year before falling post-Covid-19 pandemic. We also raise our ASP assumption to US$25 (previously US$24) for FY22F as we expect that a drop in demand growth will be minimized by the structural change in glove usage.
We maintain our HOLD call on Hartalega with a higher FV of RM16.94/share. Our valuation is based on 38x CY21F EPS. We assume higher a FY21F ASP of US$32 (previously US$28) as we believe the higher selling price will be sustained for another year before falling post-Covid-19 pandemic. We also increase our ASP assumption to US$30 (previously US$26) for FY22F.
We retain our BUY call on Kossan with a higher FV of RM12.51/share. Our valuation is based on 27x FY21F EPS. We assume a higher FY20F ASP of US$28 (previously US$26) as we believe the higher selling price will be sustained for another year before falling post-Covid-19 pandemic. We also increase our ASP assumption to US$28 (previously US$26) for FY21F.

Supermax shares were up by 6.48% or 61 sen at RM10.02 apiece, valuing the counter at some RM13.63 billion. It was a new all-time high. In total, it saw some 15.45 million shares traded.
Supermax was the fourth highest gainer on Bursa Malaysia, followed by the Supermax-C83 warrants as the fifth top gainer, gaining 6.82% or 35 sen to RM5.48.
Kossan was also on the list of top gainers as well. The counter rose by 4.29% or 40 sen apiece to RM9.72, also a new record high. It was now valued at RM12.43 billion.
Demand for rubber gloves is only expected to grow as the Covid-19 pandemic shows no signs of abating.
In a note today on rubber products, Hong Leong Investment Bank said that it was not ruling out the possibility of hastier capacity expansion by Malaysian glove manufacturers in order to fulfil increasing demand as well as to remain competitive.
“China's glove makers are aggressive with their expansion plans (about an additional 100 billion pieces by 2023). However, we feel it will not affect Malaysian glove makers in the near future, with only about 35 billion pieces by 2021 and stronger confidence in Malaysian glove production quality,” it said.
The research house added that it remained bullish on gloves for the second half of the year (2H20) given increasing demand for rubber gloves and that average selling prices (ASPs) are expected to continue rising until 1H21.
It noted that rubber glove ASPs had increased in tandem with higher utilisation rates. Since the beginning of the outbreak, ASPs have increased by about 10%. Spot order ASPs currently average at two to four times and now account for 15% to 20% of total capacity from 5% previously.

  HOW LONG CAN GLOVE RUN?
SHOULD INVESTOR CONTINUE TO INVEST AT THE PRICE NOW?
COVID-19 Pandemic
Referring to the chart below, Covid-19 cases are still on the rise and there is no indication that it will slow down anytime soon.
As of today dated 5th July 2020 the total number of cases is 11.39Million with USA, Brazil, Russia and EU being in the top of charts.
    Vaccine, to date, more than 145 vaccines are being developed and 21 are in human trials. Below are how Vaccine trial is being tested; 
A possibility of 2nd wave is already quite imminent with multiple country experiencing surge of cases and reactivation of partial lockdown in certain country. This coupled with the seasonal flu which usuallly start in September/October (Winter season) may exacerbate the situation further leading to a possible huge 2nd wave impact.
As countries in the world are struggling in re-opening their economy they are also taking huge risk in further spreading the disease.
  2. So what will this translate to the DEMAND for GLOVES ? 
There are already multiple report and analysis from local institutions (kenanga, macquarie, maybank etc) and overseas institutions (marketwatch, nikkei, financial times etc) which have noted and are well aware of the SUPER NORMAL DEMAND for rubber gloves in MEDICAL FIELD
Not only in the medical field, it is also noted that other industries  (F&B, Industrial, Services etc) are also pouring in requests for Nitrile gloves which are less allergenic compared to Latex gloves.
  3.Malaysia Glove Industry Big 4 ( Hartalega, Topglove, Kossan, Supermax)
Malaysia supplies more than 60% of the world demand, given this situation the industry players especially the big 4 of the industries are well positioned to gain ENORMOUS benefit from this demand as we noted the below positive points :
CAPACITY INCREASE
Topglov estimated annual production of 78billion gloves in 2020
Hartalega estimated annual production of 40billlion gloves in 2020
Kossan estimated annual production of 32billion gloves in 2020
Supermax estimated annual production of 26.2billion gloves in 2020
AVERAGE SELLING PRICES
From our trusted internal sources
Most company ASP are up by 5-15% month to month basis since May 2020
Spot order price soars as much as USD170 per carton
TECHNOLOGY
Malaysia glove industry are the world most advanced compared to other country piers, providing a consistent and reliable quality glove which have slated our industry players the major suppliers to USA and EU.
EXISTING PRESENCE IN THE MARKET
    As per research glove consumption has been on the rise in both developed and developing country as medical field continue to advance further. 
Figure below shows the pre-covid data on the top consumption of glove per capita of the country
  3.)As our industry are already well established in USA and Europe, the surge in demand are well received by our glove makers 
    4.) What's the fair value then?
Our top picks are still TOGLOVE & HARTALEGA,Why?
  THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN AVERAGE SELLING PRICE (ASP) AND PROFIT MARGINS
ASP is the single most important factor boosting the current glove industry into the next level.
Many do not understand how this works, thus giving and example below : 
Assuming a company produce 1billion gloves and are able to generate a sales of RM100 million (RM0.10 per glove ASP) and an average cost of RM90 million, the company will gain a net profit RM10 million (RM0.01 per glove)
Just by a mere increment of 30% ASP, the same company generating 1billion gloves will then be able to generate a sales of RM130 million, however the cost is still fixed at around RM90 million and giving the company a net profit of RM40 million with is a tremendous 300% gain.

Knowing this, if the ASP continue to rise, can you imagine the impact to their financial bottom lines?

Despite this it doesn’t means that we’re not interested in other glove counters, it is however we had manage to receive more information on the above 2 companies compared to others as such we are more keen in going with what we CONFIRMED than speculations as we can see from other smaller players which reported a somewhat under expected results.
  We’re quite sure the ASP of the above 2 companies is now already at least 100% or more since April 2020, and are still in the rise especially since their orders have been confirmed till year 2021.
  Vaccine is still the major concern for the gloves industry as it may spell an end to the COVID-19 pandemic however medical experts have already informed that the earliest possibility of vaccine will be by next year.

Given this I strongly believe the trend of glove movement is still intact given the recent corrections in the chart and especially when all big 4 gloves companies have now entered into their newest high prices as per our prediction forming a new higher high for the uptrend patterns. 
  *Note : Im holding Supermx as well, I believe it will be the company with the largest share price increase in 2020
(The average selling price of Supermx is the highest in the industry) "

    KUALA LUMPUR (July 3): Top Glove Corp Bhd's and Supermax Corp Bhd's share prices jumped to their all-time highs today as the rising number of global Covid-19 infections spurs expectations of higher demand for rubber gloves and stronger earnings for glove manufacturers.
Top Glove's share price has risen as much as 76 sen or 4.34% to its record high of RM18.26 so far today while Supermax has climbed as much as 47 sen or 5.25% to its all-time high of RM9.43.
At 3:36pm, both stocks pared gains. Top Glove was traded at RM18.14 while Supermax changed hands at RM9.36.
Meanwhile, Hartalega Holdings Bhd rose to a record high again today after its share price climbed as much as 66 sen or 4.4% to RM15.66 to surpass its previous all-time high at RM15.60 yesterday.
At 3:36pm today, Hartalega pared gains at RM15.60.
Top Glove was Bursa's top gainer followed by Hartalega. Supermax occupied the sixth place on the leading gainers list.
Top Glove and Hartalega are FBM KLCI constituents.
Glove manufacturers’ current share prices reflect the apparent relentless demand for gloves amid a resurgence in global Covid-19 infections.
Such sentiment has directed the spotlight on glove manufacturers' potential higher earnings as they capitalise on higher demand for their products.
CGS-CIMB Securities Sdn Bhd said it expects the 30-stock KLCI’s 2020 core net profit to decline by a smaller quantum following upgrades in glove players' earnings.
""Following our latest earnings revisions, we now expect the KLCI’s 2020 core net profit to decline 11% versus 15% previously, as we adjust for the upgrades in the glove players' earnings,"" CGS-CIMB analysts Ivy Ng Lee Fang and Nagulan Ravi wrote in a note yesterday.
Globally, the US is in focus as a Covid-19 hotspot. According to Reuters, the US reported more than 55,000 new Covid-19 cases on Thursday (July 2), the largest daily increase any country has ever reported.
""Coronavirus cases are rising in 37 out of 50 US states including Florida, which confirmed more than 10,000 new cases on Thursday. That marked the state's largest daily spike so far and a level that exceeded single-day tallies from any European country at the height of the outbreak there,"" reported the newswire.

In a report today (3 Jul), MQ Research reiterates Outperform on TOPGLOV, raising its target price to RM30.40, 73.7% above the current share price.
Read on for More.
Event
MQ Research is reiterating its Outperform (OP) rating on the shares of TOPGLOV and raising its target price to RM30.40, based on a lower target price-earnings (PE) of 23x (was RM20.50 on a target PE of 40x). In MQ Research’s view, the market is underestimating glove makers’ abilities to raise ASPs, and, hence, the potential ASP upside has not been fully priced in. MQ Research’s FY21E profit after tax (PAT) is 108% above consensus’.
Impact
Spot order enquiries on the rise. Management has indicated that enquiries for spot orders from the United States and Europe are on the rise due to the second wave of COVID-19. As such, the company is looking to raise the spot order allocation to more than 20% (vs last two weeks’ guidance of 20%). In MQ Research’s assumptions, it is projecting Top Glove will gradually increase its spot order allocation to 30% from 20% through 2Q FY21E (February 2021).
ASP rise higher than expected. Management has indicated that overall lead time has increased to nearly 15 months from 13–14 months two weeks ago, and the company is seeing higher conversion orders. This should provide Top Glove the power to raise its ASP. The company now plans to increase the ASP for August order deliveries higher than initial guidance of 15%. As such, MQ Research is increasing its FY20E/FY21E/FY22E ASP assumptions 3%/57%/4% to factor in both higher ASP increases and spot order allocation.
Lowering target PE on supernormal FY21E earnings. Based on the aforementioned strategy, MQ Research is projecting that FY21E’s net profit will be triple FY20E net profit. Given MQ Research’s belief that FY21E will be the peak of strong earnings that are unlikely to be repeated in following years, MQ Research is lowering its target price-earnings ratio (PER) to 23x (+0.5 SD) from 40x. To cross check the long-term fair value of the stock, MQ Research uses a discounted cash flow (DCF) methodology to derive a fair value of RM18.70, which translates to 10x FY21E/56x FY22E PERs. MQ Research views gloves as a staple within the healthcare industry and that the shares should trade at a premium multiple long term.
Earnings and Target Price Revision
MQ Research is raising its FY20E/FY21E/FY22E EPS 10%/188%/20% to reflect higher monthly sequential ASP increases and higher spot order allocations. MQ Research is also raising its target price to RM30.40 from RM20.50. MQ Research’s bear-case valuation is RM11.80.
Price Catalyst
12-month price target: RM30.40 based on a PER methodology.
Catalyst: quarterly earnings and consensus upgrades.
Action and Recommendation
MQ Research is reiterating its OP rating with a higher target price of RM30.40, which is based on a lower PER of 23x.

Top Glove makes automation push amid pandemic labor shortage
Travel restrictions and infection risks test limits of relying migrant workers

TAKASHI NAKANO, Nikkei staff writer July 2, 2020 11:53 JST
SINGAPORE -- Malaysia-based Top Glove, the world's leading producer of rubber surgical gloves, will invest 3 billion ringgit ($700 million) to modernize its production facilities in a bid to reduce the dependency on migrant workers.
Top Glove workers churn out 16,000 gloves per capita each day. But the company is having trouble keeping up with demand even at full capacity. The lead time on deliveries on synthetic nitrile rubber gloves is now stretched to 420 days.
""Intensifying automation and digitalization across every aspect of our operations remains a top business priority,"" Top Glove founder and Chairman Lim Wee Chai told Nikkei. ""We have invested in advanced technology and projects incorporating artificial intelligence and robotic process automation.""
The 3 billion ringgit will be used to add 450 new production lines through 2026. Annual output capacity will be lifted nearly 80% to 140 billion gloves, up from 78.7 billion units.
Artificial Intelligence will be used for quality control to reduce the volume of defective products and boost production efficiency. AI-equipped cameras will also analyze activities of laborers to improve workplace safety and security.
Top Glove, which exports to 195 countries, commands a global market share of 26%. The company has seen demand grow sharply amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Orders from China and Brazil have approximately quadrupled compared with before the pandemic, while orders to the U.S. swelled 150%.
The skyrocketing demand helped Top Glove earn a net profit 575 million ringgit for three quarters through May, breaking previous all-time highs for the full year.
But the COVID-19 pandemic has also brought problems associated with foreign migrant workers into sharp relief. Because of travel restrictions, companies are unable to bring in more migrant workers to help ramp up production.
""No employment of foreign workers is allowed until year-end,"" said Malaysia's Human Resources Minister M. Saravanan, sparking concerns of a drawn-out labor shortage.
Out of 13,000 factory workers hired by Top Glove, 11,000 are foreign nationals. The company's treatment of its workers has been subject to withering scrutiny as of late.
At the dormitories housing migrant workers, 24 people share the same room, one laborer said in a June expose by the British broadcaster Channel 4.
""We have to share the bathrooms with everyone in the bloc,"" said the man. ""I am scared that I will get infected with the virus.""
Top Glove immediately rejected the claims as ""highly inaccurate."" The company says it has rolled out social distancing and other measures to prevent the spread of disease.
The company also maintains that its workers' take-home pay exceeds 1,600 ringgit a month, higher than the 1,200 ringgit minimum wage. But the pay still pales in comparison to Malaysia's overall average monthly wage of roughly 3,000 ringgit.
With the inclusion of Hartalega Holdings and other Top Glove rivals, Malaysia's share in the global rubber glove market approaches 70%. This contingent derives its competitive advantage in the ability to procure rubber domestically or in nearby countries, as well as in the cheap labor costs.
The shift away from manual labor has become a cross-industry issue in Malaysia. Companies that adopt high technology make up only 37% of manufacturers, and no more than 20% of the service sector, according to the Shared Prosperity Vision 2030, a document released last year by the government under former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad."

I am very sure all the glove makers will report increased profit in the next quarter. All investors should wait about 2.5 months to see the result. 
You must remember, the increased sale price is pure profit because all the glove makers do not need production cost to be able to increase the selling price. 
As I said, the number of Covid 19 cases is still increasing and the demand for gloves will continue to exceed supply. The game is not over yet.
You should not sell your holdings now. You can make more money if you wait. Patience is the key to successful investment.
In fact, it is still not too late to buy more glove stocks. After I saw the number of Covid 19 cases is still rising, I believe my target prices for Comfort and Supermax are achievable.

The sentiment was also boosted by hopes that Congress will pass another nearly USD1 trillion fiscal stimulus package this summer.

Ahead of a possible mid-year window dressing activities and higher Brent oil prices, KLCI rose 4 pts to record its 2nd straight gain at 1511 (a tad below the 200D SMA of 1513), led by gains in IHH, PPB, TM, AXIATA, TOPGLOV, and PBBANK. Trading volume inched up to 6.33bn shares valued at RM3.11bn against last Friday’s 6.3bn shares worth RM4.9bn. Market breadth was negative with 434 gainers as compared to 549 losers.
TECHNICAL OUTLOOK: KLCI
The KLCI rose 4 pts to record its 2nd straight gain at 1511 (a tad below the 200D SMA of 1513) after tumbling 38.8 pts WoW. We reiterate that unless the benchmark can convincingly reclaim above the 200D SMA and 1543 (LT support-turned-resistance) levels, KLCI’s near term consolidation will prevail with key major support situated at 1498 (uptrend line). Failure to hold will witness further selloff towards 1474 (30D SMA) and 1440 (100D SMA) territory.
MARKET OUTLOOK
Barring a strong reclaim above the key 200D SMA at 1513 and and 1543 (the LT resistance trend line drawn from the 1896 high), the odds still favour more consolidation ahead. A decisive breakdown of the near term support trendline at 1498 would signal a deeper correction is in place, compounded by the fluidity of local political scene and the expiry of short-selling ban on 30 June. Nevertheless, hope for a mid-year window dressing activities is likely to cushion selloff with lower support at 1470 levels. As for stock picks, KLCI blue chips like Axiata, Maybank, CIMB, GenM, Genting, Sime, MISC, Topglove and Harta should witness rotational buying interests to aid uptrend resumption ahead of the mid-year window dressing.

  Still screaming buy for Top Glove as it prepares for more bumper results
  KUALA LUMPUR (June 12): Being one of the world’s best performing benchmark index component stocks thus far and even after more than tripling its share price since the beginning of this year, Top Glove Corp Bhd remains as the favourite among research firms.
Poised for a record-breaking financial year ending Aug 31, 2020 (FY20), after the quantum leap in earnings seen in Top Glove’s third quarter ended May 31, 2020 (3QFY20), three-quarters of the analysts covering the counter are screaming “buy” calls.
According to Bloomberg, out of the 20 analysts covering the stock, half of them have target prices of RM20 and above, with the highest at RM25 from CGS-CIMB Research and Kenanga Research. This would also imply a 49% headroom from the current share price.
While global markets are experiencing a second wave of global rout after the dovish comment from the US Federal Reserve, shares of Top Glove remain steady and were up 12 sen or 0.72% at RM16.82 at noon break.
“We continue to like Top Glove as the key beneficiary of the current favourable supply-demand dynamic in the glove sector due to the Covid-19 outbreak, given that it is the world’s largest glove maker by capacity (78.7 billion pieces per annum currently),” said CGS-CIMB Research Walter Aw, in a note yesterday.
Going forward, he expects Top Glove to continue recording sequentially stronger results on a quarterly basis in FY21 on the back of higher glove sales, further increase in average selling prices (ASPs), and better economies of scale.
With the strong global demand for gloves, Top Glove has also been gradually increasing its production capacity and it expects to reach 100.4 billion pieces by the end of FY21.
Furthermore, Top Glove also plans to raise the ASPs by 15% a month in July and August respectively, which would widen its profit margin.
The rubber glove maker’s profit margin swelled to 21% in 3QFY20 versus 6% in the preceding year corresponding quarter.
Some staying cautious, despite being confident of stronger results to come
Still, as Top Glove's share price has tripled in the last five-and-a-half months, a couple of analysts are turning cautious, despite the stronger earnings outlook, and have downgraded their calls for Top Glove to “hold” as they believe that the positive has already been priced in.
Out of the 20 analysts covering the stock, five have “neutral” ratings on the rubber glove maker.
PublicInvest Research analyst Chua Siu Li, for one, has downgraded the call on Top Glove to “neutral” from “outperform”, with a higher target price of RM19.30 from RM12.70 previously.
“While we do not discount the fact that Top Glove is capable of delivering record-breaking profits, we believe the exceptionally strong results are not sustainable in the long run, hence we deem it is unjustified to continue valuing Top Glove at 43 times price-to-earnings (PE) (+2SD of its five-year historical mean),” said Chua, in a note today.
In that regard, Chua is cutting PE multiple on Top Glove to 31 times (+1SD of its five-year historical mean).
Valuation-wise, Top Glove's trailing 12-month PE stood at 71.88 times — the highest among its peers, according to Bloomberg. It is also very expensive when compared to its five-year average PE of 23.87 times.
Additionally, Chua also highlighted the possible risk of the government imposing windfall tax as the glove industry is one of the very few sectors that benefited significantly from the pandemic outbreak. Previously, the government had imposed a windfall tax on the plantation sector.
Nonetheless, she reckoned that the chances of this happening to the glove sector is low as gloves are predominantly for the export markets and unlike the plantation sector, there is no urgent need to stabilise glove prices in the domestic market.
However, Chua is also adopting a more cautious stance on Top Glove currently, as its share price has rallied circa 180% since an upgrade in end-January. She is of the view that the risk-reward ratio has turned less favourable for investors currently.
HSBC’s Shuo Han Tan, on the other hand, has maintained a “hold” rating with a target price of RM15 — the lowest among the research firms."

KUALA LUMPUR: Public Investment Bank Bhd has cut its rating on the rubber glove sector to ""neutral"" from ""overweight""as it believes the supernormal profit is not sustainable in the long run.
Furthermore, PublicInvest said the glove stocks' current valuation had ran ahead of their fundamentals.
The firm said the Covid-19 pandemic outbreak had led to sharp spike in rubber gloves demand in recent months, as distributors and government agencies scramble to buy more medical gloves, in fear of a dire shortage of protective gears.
""The desperation for gloves has driven ASP (average selling price) higher and we expect the price uptrend to continue as demand for gloves remains strong,"" it said in a report today.
""However, we caution that such strong profits are unsustainable in the long-run and we expect earnings to peak in calendar year 2021, therefore we reckon it is not justifiable to continue valuing the glove players at +2SD (standard deviation) of its respective five-year historical mean,""it added.
PublicInvest revised Hartalega Holdings Bhd and Kossan Rubber Industries Bhd's earnings forecast for financial years 2020-2022 by 11-124 per cent to account for the higher ASP assumption and operational efficiency.
The firm kept its ""neutral"" call on Kossan and Hartalega, but upgraded Top Glove Corp Bhd to ""trading buy"" as its target price implied an upside of 25 per cent following a retracement in its share price since its recent downgrade.
""We reduce our price earnings multiple for both Hartalega and Kossan to 38x and 26x respectively, which is at +1SD of its five-year historical mean,"" PublicInvest said.

The desperation for gloves has driven ASP higher and we expect the price uptrend to continue as demand for gloves remains strong. We adjust Hartalega and Kossan’s earnings forecast for FY20-FY22F by 11-124% to account for the higher ASP assumption and operational efficiency. We maintain our Neutral call on Kossan and Hartalega, but we upgrade Top Glove to Trading Buy, as our TP implies an upside of 25% following a retracement in its share price since our recent downgrade. We cut our rating on the sector to Neutral, as we believe the supernormal profit is not sustainable in the long run while current valuation has ran ahead of the fundamentals.
Supply shortage. Fuelled by a shortage in global supply, the glove makers are currently experiencing a sector-wide ASP uptrend. However, we reckon that the quantum of ASP increase differs for glove makers under our coverage universe, with Top Glove having the most flexibility in terms of ASP revision. This is particularly due to the difference in client profile, as Top Glove has a more diversified customer base, with its largest customer contributing to less than 4% of its topline, hence it is able to adjust ASP upwards more swiftly compared to its peers.
The players are also seeing a spike in ad-hoc orders due to government agencies and NGOs rushing in to replenish their inventories at a rate faster than drawdowns, CSR initiatives to distribute to the needy countries as well as preparation for a potential second wave of Covid-19. Note that these ad hoc orders are generally priced at a 50-150% premium as compared to the normal recurring orders. The increase in ad-hoc orders only started to gradually pick up in the month of May and the glove makers have guided that all incoming new capacities will be allocated to cater for spot orders.
Overwhelming orders. Glove players are experiencing an overwhelming amount of orders since the start of the global pandemic. Top Glove has secured orders for delivery up until 2QCY21, while Kossan has orders lined up until 1QCY21. As for Hartalega, the Group has also been allocating capacity to clients ahead of time, and the orders will only be locked in c.2 months prior to the delivery of goods, similar to the industry-wide practice. Although some of the orders locked in ahead of time were secured with a certain amount of deposit for some glove makers, however, we do not rule out the possibility of buyers having the option to push back on deliveries should Covid-19 starts to subside, which would delay revenue recognition.
Raw material prices. The glove makers benefitted from low raw material cost in 1H2020 as the implementation of lockdown measures have resulted in a slump in prices for commodities such as latex and crude oil. However, latex prices have gradually recovered since late-March as China started to relax its lockdown measures, coupled with the effects of wintering period. Note that wintering period falls between the month of February and May and it typically reduces production yield by 45-60% from its peak period, leading to higher prices.
Despite the end of wintering period, we expect raw material prices to continue trending upwards as we believe that the gradual reopening of economies will help to support the global automotive sector’s recovery and The International Rubber Study Group (IRSG) has revealed that the tire manufacturing sector accounts for 71% of the world’s rubber usage. Therefore, we are of view that the rubber prices will not slump in 2H20. While the quantum of ASP increase in the coming months should sufficiently cover the impact of higher raw material cost, margin expansion could be lower than expected.
Downgrade to Neutral. We believe the glove players to continue delivering record high profit in the coming quarters, mainly supported by the ASP increase. As such, we raise our FY20-22F earnings forecast for Kossan and Hartalega by 11-124% to reflect the impact of higher ASP and operational efficiency as the glove makers ramp up their operations to fulfill the influx of orders. However, we caution that such strong profits are unsustainable in the long-run and we expect earnings to peak in CY21F, therefore we reckon it is not justifiable to continue valuing the glove players at +2SD of its respective 5- year historical mean. Meanwhile, we reduce our PE multiple for both Hartalega and Kossan to 38x and 26x respectively, which is at +1SD of its 5-year historical mean. We also downgrade our recommendation on the rubber glove sector from Overweight to Neutral, taking into consideration that the exceptional earnings cannot be maintained for an extended period of time.
Hartalega. We adjust our earnings forecast for FY21-22F by 35-124% to account for the higher ASP assumption as well as operational efficiency. Our TP is subsequently raised to RM11.10, with an implied PE multiple of 38x (at 1SD of its 5-year historical mean), based on a CY21F EPS of 29.2sen. Maintain Neutral.
Kossan. Similarly, we also lift Kossan’s FY20-21F earnings projections by 11-70% to take into account the effects of higher ASP, as well as better economies of scale as the Group continues to ramp up its production. Our TP remains unchanged at RM8.80, as we cut our PE multiple to 26x (at +1SD of its 5-year historical mean), based on a CY21F EPS of 33.9sen. Maintain Neutral.
Top Glove. We maintain our earnings forecast for Top Glove, with an unchanged TP of RM19.30, implying a PE multiple of 31x (+1SD of its 5- year historical mean) on CY21F EPS of 62.3sen. Top Glove’s share price has retraced since our previous downgrade and given an upside potential of 25%, we upgrade Top Glove to Trading Buy as we expect its earnings growth to be relatively stronger than its peers, considering its flexibility in raising ASP.

Usually all institutional investors are holding several stocks in their portfolios and they have to sell most of them to cut loss to buy good growth stocks like glove stocks. That is why the daily traded volume is tens of million shares.
As a result, all glove stocks have shot up a few hundred percent in the last 2 or 3months. As I said before, no stock can continue to go up higher and higher for whatever reasons. After some time, the price must correct. In the last few days, all glove stocks without exception are under correction.
Moreover, many weak-minded investors believe that the glove shares prices cannot go up anymore because China and US will soon find a cure for the coronavirus. It will take another few months to go through the various stages of testing before it is tested by humans. Federal Drug Authority (FDA) will also take some time to approve the use of the vaccine.
Glove stock price will continue to go up higher.
The glove stock price will soon rebound because the number of Covid 19 cases is still increasing in most countries around the world. Many scientists predicted the pandemic will not be under control for at least another 1 years. In fact, WHO just reported 150,000 new Covid 19 cases, the biggest number of Covid 19 cases in a single day. Currently there are 9.412 million cases and 481,000 deaths in the world. The chart below shows that the daily new cases is still increasing.
      As shown on the above table, currently US has 2.435 million Covid 19 cases and 124,000 deaths. These 2 figures are still increasing at an alarming rate.
Why the US has 26% of the total number of Covid 19 cases in the world when its population is only about 4% of total number of people in the world?
The only reason is President Trump is like a blind man, groping in the dark. He called the coronavirus Chinese virus and Kungflu. He does not follow his advisers. He thinks he knows everything. 
What you should do?
Unfortunately, there are some weak holders without foresight are also selling. Those smarter investors who sold at higher prices are taking advantage of this good buying opportunity to make more money.
Those who did not sell at higher prices should not worry because due to Covid 19 pandemic the demand for gloves far exceeds supply. As a result, glove price continues to go up higher and higher. As you can see all glove makers have reported increased profit in the last quarter.
I am very sure all the glove makers will report increased profit in the next quarter. All investors should wait about 2.5 months to see the result. 
You must remember, the increased sale price is pure profit because all the glove makers do not need production cost to be able to increase the selling price. 
As I said, the number of Covid 19 cases is still increasing and the demand for gloves will continue to exceed supply. The game is not over yet.
You should not sell your holdings now. You can make more money if you wait. Patience is the key to successful investment.
In fact, it is still not too late to buy more glove stocks. After I saw the number of Covid 19 cases is still rising, I believe my target prices for Comfort and Supermax are achievable.

Demand switch to nitrile gloves (from vinyl gloves) is prevalent in the developed markets and we think China could catch-up with this trend in the coming years. Taking into consideration of the aggressive supply from China, we think industry demand-supply could balance in 2H21, and oversupply risk is likelier in 2022. In our earnings estimates, we have already assumed for lower ASPs in 2021-22E.
Our top pick remains Top Glove (BUY, Target Price MYR21.90) for its faster near-term ASP hikes and undemanding CY21E P/E of 17x (below 5-year mean of 19x).
US: Moving Away From Plastic Vinyl Gloves
Vinyl gloves: The ‘poison plastic’ gloves
Vinyl gloves are made out of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), which produce dangerous quantities of dioxin and other carcinogenic emissions across their life-cycle (from manufacturing to landfill disposal). Additionally, some of the vinyl gloves are also found to contain toxic plasticizer chemicals called ortho-phthalates (THAL-eights) that can leach into food.
As a result, the demand has gradually switched from vinyl to nitrile rubber gloves in the US, and we note that the trend started as early as 1999, for the medical gloves segment. The key hindrance for switching lies in the cost as nitrile gloves ASP is > 50% higher than that of vinyl gloves.
Medical: Switching started as early as 1999
Kaiser Permanente, one of the larger healthcare providers in the US, had switched from vinyl gloves to nitrile gloves in 1999 due to the toxicity concern. We note that the plastic medical gloves demand in US peaked in 2008-12, and has been on a steady declining trend since 2013. However, the vinyl medical gloves have yet to be fully phased out, and plastic medical gloves accounted for 5% of US total glove import value in 4M20.
Food industry: Switching accelerated in 2019
For the food industry, the safer alternatives are nitrile and polyethylene gloves (i.e. PE gloves). The PE gloves are also a type of plastic gloves, but are safer than vinyl gloves as they do not cause dioxin pollution and do not contain the toxic plasticizer. However, the quality of PE gloves is inferior to that of nitrile as PE gloves are loose-fitting, less durable and not impervious to liquids. Hence, if one is not budget-constrained, the preference would still be for the nitrile gloves.
We note that the demand switch started gradually in 2018, and was only more apparent in the numbers in 2019, with US import value of plastic non-medical gloves falling 22% y-o-y (partially due to lower vinyl glove ASP). In 4M20, US import value of plastic non-medical gloves fell 9% y-o-y (despite higher vinyl glove ASP) and plastic non-medical gloves accounted for 12% of total US gloves import value. Further switching ahead would accelerate the demand for nitrile gloves.
Huge market share gains potential in developing markets
In US, plastic accounts for 17% of US glove import value, and we believe rubber gloves could displace 5-10% of the plastic glove market size in the coming years, if US fully phases-out vinyl gloves, and there is still demand for the cheap PE gloves.
We believe developing markets, such as China and India, are predominantly using vinyl gloves and may also steadily switch to nitrile gloves in the coming years. In total, China and India account for only 5% of Malaysia’s export volume, despite their big population size (35% of world’s population).
China: Supply to US and Demand Outlook
US lifted import tariffs on China’s gloves in mid-Mar 2020
Due to the severe gloves shortage, the US has lifted the punitive import tariffs on China’s gloves in mid-Mar 2020. Presently, the import tariff on China’s rubber examination gloves has reduced to zero (from 7.5% under the ‘Phase 1’ trade deal in Jan 2020 - the original import tariff was 15% in Sep 2019).
Meanwhile, the import tariff on China’s non-medical rubber gloves has been reduced to 3% (from 28%). The recent revisions have leveled the playing fields for all the key gloves-exporting countries. As for the plastic gloves, there have been no import tariffs imposed as China is almost the sole supplier to the US (i.e. no alternatives).
Following the exemption of import tariffs, US imports of China’s exam gloves doubled m-o-m in Apr 2020 on low base effect, with China’s market share increasing to 15% in Apr 2020 (vs. 71% for Malaysia). Despite the higher supply from China, gloves supply is still tight in the US and glove players from the key producing countries (i.e. Malaysia, China and Thailand) managed to push through higher ASPs from Mar 2020 until now.
Post-COVID 19, we think the US may reinstate the punitive import tariffs on China’s exam and non-medical gloves, which may result in China losing market share in the US again.
China may also phase out vinyl gloves
The rubber glove penetration rate is extremely low in China, with consumption per capita of only 8 pieces, compared to 90-300 pieces in the developed markets. In our view, the low rubber gloves consumption in China could be due to their heavy reliance on vinyl gloves, which is produced locally.
Given the toxicity of the vinyl gloves and China’s government policies in reducing environmental pollution over recent years, we believe China’s end-demand may also steadily switch to nitrile gloves. Hence, China’s glove-makers will need to embark on aggressive nitrile glove capacity expansion plans to cater for the huge local demand, which would otherwise be met by higher imports. That said, there would still be demand for the cheaper vinyl gloves and we note that China is moving its vinyl glove production to Vietnam.
In the event that China’s rubber gloves consumption grows and eventually matches developed market’s rubber glove consumption of 90 pieces per capita (low-end of the range), we estimate that China’s rubber glove market size could jump 11x to 125.4b pieces (from around 11.1b pieces presently), accounting for half of global rubber glove market size of 263b pcs in 2019.
We believe China’s migration to rubber gloves could be supply-led in the next 5 years, in view of the local players’ aggressive capacity expansion in the nitrile space.
China importing more from Malaysia
China accounts for approximately 3% of Malaysia’s glove exports volume. Though the infection rate of COVID-19 has reduced to almost zero in China, we note that China’s demand for Malaysia’s rubber gloves is still higher than pre-COVID 19 levels. In Apr 2020, Malaysia’s rubber exam glove export to China was 2.2x higher than the pre-COVID 19 level in Dec 2019 (in value terms) and we understand that the demand from China remains elevated until now. Additionally, China is also paying higher ASPs, similar to the ASP hikes in other markets. The strong demand could be due to the stock replenishment requirement and also preparation for a potential second wave.
Alook at China’s Glove-makers
Blue Sail: To add 30b pieces nitrile capacity in 3 years
Blue Sail could be China’s largest glove producer, with its capacity predominantly in vinyl gloves (or PVC gloves) and less in other gloves (nitrile, latex, surgical). In FY19, the glove division accounted for 48% of the group’s revenue and 9% of group pretax profit, on a pretax margin of just 3% (vs. 9-19% for Malaysia’s Big4). In FY19, the glove division registered revenue of CNY1.7b (or MYR1b) and pretax profit of CNY53m (or MYR32m).
Presently, it has a total production capacity of 20b pcs p.a., out of which, 15b pcs p.a. is from vinyl gloves, 4b pcs p.a. is from the nitrile gloves and the balance 1b pcs p.a. is from other gloves (i.e. surgical, latex).
In 2020, following the convertible bond fundraising exercise, Blue Sail plans to add total new capacity of 6b pcs p.a., out of which, 4b pcs p.a. is for the vinyl gloves and 2b pcs p.a. is for the nitrile gloves.
Just recently, in June 2020, the company laid out its aggressive expansion plans for the next 3 years:
Nitrile gloves – To build total new capacity of 30b pcs p.a. by Dec 2023, with capacity construction to commence in 3Q20. The Phase 1 of the expansion will see 10b pcs p.a. capacity commencing trial run in mid-2021. Meanwhile, the trial run of Phase 2 is scheduled for Dec 2021 but the capacity size is not mentioned. Given that the expansion plan is up to Dec 2023, we think the entire expansion may only complete in 2023 and the company may adjust its expansion plan according to market demand; and
Vinyl gloves – Only adding 800m pcs p.a. vinyl gloves capacity in Vietnam.
Adjusting for the timing of the capacity commencement dates, we estimate that Blue Sail’s effective nitrile glove capacity growth would be 25%/153%/151%/13% in 2020-23E. The growth rate looks alarming due to its low nitrile glove capacity base of just 4b pcs p.a. presently. In terms of the absolute new capacity, its growth rate is 1b pcs/7.7b pcs/19.2b pcs/4.2b pcs over 2020-23E; this is similar to the expansion pace of Top Glove but faster than the other key players in Malaysia and Thailand.
Our estimated effective nitrile capacity for Blue Sail represents 0.3%/2%/5% of our projected global rubber glove demand in 2020-22E. This reaffirms our belief that supply will catch up with demand in 2021 and oversupply risk is likelier in 2022.
Including the vinyl gloves, Blue Sail’s total capacity could be 60b pcs p.a. by end-2023, with total nitrile gloves capacity of 36b pcs p.a. This would still be smaller than our expected rubber glove capacity size of 40-110b pcs p.a. for the Big 5 by end-2023.
Intco Medical: To add 45b pieces nitrile capacity in 5 years
Intco Medical could be China’s top 3 glove producer by capacity. It manufactures a wide range of healthcare products:
gloves (i.e. vinyl, nitrile);
medical equipment (eg. wheelchair, over bed table, cane/walker, shower chair);
nonwoven disposables (eg. protective gowns, caps, face shield, shoe cover); and
other products (eg. hand sanitizer gel, hot/cold packs).
However, there is no segmental earnings breakdown for us to gauge its gloves earnings/margins.
In FY19, the group recorded revenue of CNY2.1b (or MYR1.3b) and pretax profit of CNY203m (or MYR123m) on pretax margin of 10% (similar to Malaysia’s Big4). In 1Q20, its pretax profit jumped to CNY152m (or MYR92m) on a higher pretax margin of 20%. We think 1Q20 earnings could be partially boosted by exceptional gains as its operating income jumped to CNY150m (+CNY125m y-o-y) and accounted for almost the entire pretax profit in 1Q20.
In 2019, Intco Medical’s total production capacity stood at approximately 19b pcs p.a., out of which, vinyl accounted for 14b pcs p.a. and nitrile accounted for 5b pcs p.a. Intco Medical’s total glove capacity size is similar to that of Blue Sail.
Intco Medical has also laid out aggressive expansion plans for the next 5 years. By end-2025, its total capacity could be approximately 78b pcs p.a., out of which 50b is slated for nitrile glove capacity.
According to media reports, Intco Medical will commercialise 20 nitrile glove production lines and 19 vinyl glove production lines in 2020, totaling 9b pcs p.a. capacity. The target commencement dates for the new capacity are May and Sep 2020. We estimate that Intco Medical’s effective nitrile glove capacity growth would be 64%/103%/48%/32%/24%/20% in 2020-25E. In terms of the absolute new capacity, its growth rate is 3.2b pcs/8.5b pcs/8.0b pcs over 2020-22E.
Our estimated effective nitrile capacity for Intco Medical represents 1%/2%/2% of our projected global rubber glove demand in 2020-22E. We think the market would be able to absorb the new supply from Intco Medical as we project global demand to grow 20% p.a. in 2020-21E.
China Has No Cost Advantage Over Malaysia
According to media reports on Blue Sail, the capex for each vinyl production line is CNY8m (or MYR5m) and construction takes 8 months. As for the nitrile gloves, capex for each production line is CNY26m (or MYR16m) and construction takes 12 months. We note that the capex per nitrile production line is similar to Malaysia’s players (i.e. MYR15-20m), and hence, we believe there is no construction cost advantage in China.
In terms of production costs, China’s cost could be similar or more expensive than that of Malaysia:
NBR raw material – This is the biggest cost item. Similar to Malaysia, China also has local NBR raw material supply but the capacity is relatively small. So, China’s glove producers will also need to import its NBR raw material;
Gas – This is the second biggest cost item and the cost of gas in China is around 45% higher than in Malaysia;
Labour – This is the third biggest cost item and the wages in China is about 2% lower than that of Malaysia.
Additionally, China has abundant worker supply while Malaysia relies on foreign workers.
Maybank-KE’s Demand-supply Projections
Global demand: +20% p.a. in 2020-21E
The global demand in 2020-21 would be supply-led as there is not enough capacity to cater to the sudden demand jump stemming from COVID-19. For the world’s Big 5 (i.e. Top Glove, Hartalega, Kossan, Supermax and Sri Trang Agro (SGX:NC2)), we estimate combined effective capacity growth of 16%/19% in 2020-21E. Accounting for capacity growth from other players, we project global demand to grow 20% p.a. in 2020-21E.
For Blue Sail and Intco Medical, we estimate that the combined new capacity from the two China’s glove players would account for 1% and 4% of our 2020-21E global demand. Given the stock replenishment requirement and the long sales lead time into mid-2021, we believe the market would only reach equilibrium in 2H21, and short-medium term oversupply risk is low.
Oversupply risk potentially in 2022E
For 2022E, we assumed for 8% global demand growth rate (similar to its historical 5-year CAGR). We estimate combined effective capacity growth of 12% for the Big 5. For Blue Sail and Intco Medical, the combined new capacity looks alarming as it would account for 7% of our projected global demand in 2022E. However, we think the new capacity could be absorbed by its local China market as it needs to replace some of its vinyl gloves consumption with nitrile.
Moreover, given that the margins of the China glove-makers are not superior to that of Malaysia’s glove-makers, we believe the ASP pressure from the China peers may not be excessive in an oversupply situation.
We also believe that the China players are rational and would adjust their expansion plans according to the market’s demand. An irrational expansion will also jeopardise their profitability and return on investment (ROI).

Global: Tracking higher Covid-19 cases, Asian markets ended mixed as investors mulled further signs of outbreaks after the WHO said the global tally for Covid-19 has topped 9m cases while South Korea declared its resurgence a 2nd wave. Meanwhile, the Dow soared 153 pts to 26025 whilst the tech-heavy Nasdaq surged 110 pts at a record high of 10056, as investors weighed optimism over a steady recovery in the US economy against worries of soaring virus infections in half of all US states and elsewhere in the world. The sentiment was also boosted by hopes that Congress will pass another nearly USD1 trillion fiscal stimulus package this summer.
Malaysia. Ahead of a possible mid-year window dressing activities and higher Brent oil prices, KLCI rose 4 pts to record its 2nd straight gain at 1511 (a tad below the 200D SMA of 1513), led by gains in IHH, PPB, TM, AXIATA, TOPGLOV, and PBBANK. Trading volume inched up to 6.33bn shares valued at RM3.11bn against last Friday’s 6.3bn shares worth RM4.9bn. Market breadth was negative with 434 gainers as compared to 549 losers.
TECHNICAL OUTLOOK: KLCI
The KLCI rose 4 pts to record its 2nd straight gain at 1511 (a tad below the 200D SMA of 1513) after tumbling 38.8 pts WoW. We reiterate that unless the benchmark can convincingly reclaim above the 200D SMA and 1543 (LT support-turned-resistance) levels, KLCI’s near term consolidation will prevail with key major support situated at 1498 (uptrend line). Failure to hold will witness further selloff towards 1474 (30D SMA) and 1440 (100D SMA) territory.
MARKET OUTLOOK
Barring a strong reclaim above the key 200D SMA at 1513 and and 1543 (the LT resistance trend line drawn from the 1896 high), the odds still favour more consolidation ahead. A decisive breakdown of the near term support trendline at 1498 would signal a deeper correction is in place, compounded by the fluidity of local political scene and the expiry of short-selling ban on 30 June. Nevertheless, hope for a mid-year window dressing activities is likely to cushion selloff with lower support at 1470 levels. As for stock picks, KLCI blue chips like Axiata, Maybank, CIMB, GenM, Genting, Sime, MISC, Topglove and Harta should witness rotational buying interests to aid uptrend resumption ahead of the mid-year window dressing.

How the world’s largest maker of rubber gloves is coping with Covid
Top Glove founder pledges to expand output to fight ‘very strong, very smart’ virus

    As the founder and chairman of the world’s largest rubber glove manufacturer, Lim Wee Chai was not new to health crises when coronavirus struck this year. In its three-decade history, his company Top Glove has responded to outbreaks of H1N1 influenza, Sars and Ebola as well as the HIV/Aids epidemic.
But Covid-19 has spread so far and so fast that it is unlike any other pathogen Lim has ever seen. “This time with Covid-19 the scale is much bigger,” says the 62-year-old billionaire from Top Glove’s Kuala Lumpur headquarters in an FT interview over Zoom. “The whole world has been affected by this pandemic . . . This virus is very strong, very smart . . . Human beings have to think of a better way to overcome the problem”.
While most companies around the globe have been hit by national lockdowns, plunging sales and deep recession, Malaysia-based Top Glove is one of the fortunate few to be making products that are now in the highest demand.
The company’s main challenge has been to keep its 44 factories around the world running 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to meet soaring orders for medical gloves from 195 countries, practically every state on the planet.

“Before Covid-19 our production capacity was running at about 85 per cent,” says Lim. “Because of good demand it [has] now increased to 100 per cent. In fact we are also building more new lines, more capacity”.
Even so, Top Glove’s lead time for orders has increased almost 10 times, from 30-40 days to nearly 300 days. Prices are rising as well as output, even as rival rubber glove makers in Malaysia and key Chinese competitors manufacturing from vinyl expand volumes to meet global annual demand now seen as far exceeding last year’s 290bn pieces.
Top Glove’s share price has risen more than 250 per cent this year, giving it a market value of about $10bn in early June. With a 27 per cent stake, Lim himself is now worth about $2.6bn, according to Forbes, the US business media group, putting him among Asia’s 778 billionaires.
His success in the midst of a pandemic is only the latest reminder of south-east Asia’s rising economic and financial clout, with ambassadors from the developed world, including Japan, Australia and the Netherlands, beating a path to his door to help solve supply crises on which their citizens’ health depends.
Top Glove — which claims to account for 26 per cent of the world market for rubber gloves — is an example of the kind of added-value own-brand production the Malaysian government has long sought to help lift the nation from middle-income status into the ranks of advanced economies.
Lim’s personal history reflects this modernisation drive, which has seen an economy based on commodities industrialise and diversify. His ethnic Chinese parents went into business as traders and rubber plantation owners when the country was still emerging from the British empire.
Lim’s early life coincided with the tumultuous early years of Malaysia’s independence, which were marked by tensions between the majority ethnic Malays and the smaller, but largely wealthier, Chinese community, culminating in race riots in 1969. The Malay-dominated government eased the conflict by developing pro-Malay policies which still left scope for Chinese families to succeed, principally in business.
Before founding Top Glove, Lim worked in sales at OYL Industries, a Malaysian air conditioner manufacturer later acquired by Japan’s Daikin, and then went to study in the US, completing an MBA at Sul Ross State University in Texas. He started Top Glove in 1991 with a single production line in a factory in Meru, near Kuala Lumpur, and 100 employees. The company was floated in Kuala Lumpur in 2001 and listed in Singapore, on the region’s most international exchange, in 2016.

Lim’s hands-on business style is widely seen as the source of his success. In rising to commercial prominence, and now in tackling coronavirus, he takes one step at a time. “Every day we have so many problems: marketing problems, supplier problems, production problems . . . every day we solve. If no problem, it’s not a business,” he says.
“You could call him a real industrialist,” says Rizal Ishak, a consultant to Malaysia’s glove manufacturers, citing a strict management culture focused on ensuring seamless production and that “everything is funded well . . . He runs a very tight shop, no question”.
Among the “chairman philosophies” listed on Top Glove’s website is a call on staff to clean, eat, work, exercise and sleep well to achieve “reverse ageing”, accompanied by a photo of Lim playing badminton. Another section lists four types of learners: fast, slow, non-learner or wrong learner. “The choice is yours. What will you choose?” the chairman asks.
The down-to-earth approach is serving the company well with Covid-19. Lim expects sales in the year to August to grow 30 per cent to more than 6bn Malaysian ringgit (US$1.4bn) from RM4.8bn in the last financial year. That compares with a compound annual growth rate of 21 per cent in the last 19 years. CIMB, a Malaysian bank, forecasts Top Glove’s net profit to more than double from RM368m in 2019 to RM864m this year and RM1.2bn by 2021.
Every day we have so many problems: marketing, suppliers, production . . . every day we solve
Lim Wee Chai
The overwhelming demand, which has seen desperate governments leapfrogging each other to buy protective gear for health workers, has allowed glove manufacturers to raise prices. Lim says the price of his gloves has grown about 10 per cent per month since February while the “spot” price, for immediate delivery, has doubled. “But 90 per cent [of our glove output] is sold to our regular customers. Ten per cent may be [sold at the] spot price”.
He says the company did what it could to fill orders coming from around the world and to answer the foreign diplomats’ appeals. “They asked us to help. We did our best to try to fulfil their requirements,” says Lim, adding he also recently received inquiries from the World Health Organization on behalf of less developed countries in Africa and elsewhere.
Top Glove is well placed to benefit commercially. Walter Aw, a senior analyst at CIMB, says that among its Malaysian competitors, “Top Glove is in a prime position to benefit because they’re the largest glove maker in terms of capacity [and they have] the largest distribution network.”
Ramping up production amid global supply chain glitches and closed borders has not been easy. Malaysia itself imposed a near-total lockdown from mid-March, which only started to ease earlier this month.
Top Glove’s suppliers, mainly located in Malaysia, which accounts for the bulk of its output alongside plants in Thailand and China, shut down for about a fortnight. But with the company typically holding two weeks’ stock of raw materials, Lim says production did not suffer. “If suppliers [had] continued to delay our stock for one month then we’d be in trouble,” he adds.
Lim says that avoiding coronavirus contagion among his workforce has been a challenge, but that employing doctors, nurses, pharmacists, nutritionists and dentists on site has helped Top Glove manage the risks.
The company, with 19,000 employees, is also facing labour shortages as it looks to increase its 12,000-strong production floor staff to ensure it runs at full capacity.
While foreign workers account for about 60 per cent of Top Glove’s personnel, mainly from Nepal and Bangladesh, Malaysia’s closing of its borders in March forced the company to focus on hiring locally. “[We] still have some shortage . . . but we should be able to get enough workers from companies that are retrenching and reducing their workforce,” he says.
Difficulties recruiting labour, even from abroad, have landed the industry in controversy over claims that employers have exploited migrant workers. In December 2018, The Guardian newspaper reported allegations from 16 foreign workers employed at Top Glove in Malaysia that they were required to work long hours for low pay. They also claimed that they had had their passports held by the company and were unable to get them back. Labour activists regard this practice as coercive as it can hinder a worker’s freedom of movement.
Top Glove told The Guardian at the time that it was working to address excessive overtime working. It said it met “local labour law requirements” and had “a zero-tolerance policy with any regard to the abuse” of human rights. Asked for comment by the FT for this article, Top Glove denied any wrongdoing, citing its 2019 annual report in which it said the Guardian report was “highly inaccurate” and set out detailed changes in labour policies. The annual report says the company had “revised” its safekeeping policy on foreign workers’ passports and “workers now have full custody of their passports”. Top Glove told the FT that the policy was changed in December 2018.
The annual report also refers to steps the company has taken to tackle another problem often linked with migrant labour — heavy recruitment charges imposed by employment agents on workers. The Top Glove report says that in January 2019, the company implemented a “zero recruitment fee policy” under which it bears “all the recruitment fees and costs associated with accommodation, medical check-ups and travelling”.
It did not answer an FT question about who paid the recruitment fees before the policy change but said “we continuously improve and strengthen” our policies and it had ended relationships with recruitment agents who failed to meet its standards.
In the longer term, Malaysian glove makers face structural challenges. While the industry is now in the limelight, its products are low-added-value goods, selling for low prices (outside a pandemic). By value, medical and non-sterile gloves represent only 1.3 per cent of Malaysia’s total exports of goods and services.
Richard Record, lead economist for Malaysia at the World Bank, says productivity remains a concern for a sector that relies heavily on labour-intensive manufacturing. So if Malaysia wants to fulfil its aspiration of becoming a high-income country, “it will be key to focus more on building the quality of workforce skills, promoting quality investments, and intensifying technology adoption across all sectors of the economy to boost competitiveness, including in the manufacture of protective medical equipment,” he adds.
If he is right, the glove makers’ problems in hiring low-cost labour will only multiply. So will the challenges for the rubber producers, who have in recent years abandoned plantations because prices have been too low.
And even though Malaysia is the world’s third-largest rubber grower, it is also the third-biggest importer, as demand far exceeds local supply. The glove makers source two-thirds of their needs for latex — a semi-processed material made from rubber — via imports, mainly from other south-east Asian states.

In its annual report, Top Glove says its financial performance is susceptible to commodity price fluctuations, particularly in latex. But Aw, the CIMB analyst, is not worried given that an oversupply of latex is keeping it cheap while rubber glove prices are rising.
Lim remains optimistic about the future. Top Glove will overcome the current global recession “because we are in the right industry and we have the right team of people,” he says. “We have overcome five epidemics over the past 30 years. That’s why we must have a good foundation.”
The company is investing in new products, including biodegradable gloves, self-cleaning gloves, low-allergy gloves and moisturising gloves. It has diversified into condoms, dental products and latex tourniquets.
Looking ahead, he is clear about Top Glove’s objectives. He wants his company to join the Fortune Global 500 by 2040, which will involve increasing the company’s revenues 30-fold and expanding to 500 factories. “If we put enough effort I’m sure we can achieve our target in 20 years,” he says.
As for personal goals, Lim is determined to live until he is 120 years old by following the principles of healthy living he has enshrined at Top Glove. “I am still very young . . . it’s just started”.

__________________________________________________________

Following up with our earlier article ""Commentaries on The Recent Glove Sector Selldown Since Top Glove Results Announcement"", this time around we are studying the sector during the previous H1N1 pandemic and will try to draw some key-takeaways that could be useful for gauging the current Covid-19 situation. To ease our analysis, we only consider the earnings trend and share price performance of Top Glove, Supermax & Hartalega.

According to Wikipedia, H1N1 lasted for about 19 months, from Jan 2009 to Aug-10 while vaccine for the influenza was approved by the FDA in September 2009. During this period, we saw quarterly earnings of glove companies rising by c.2-4x to its peak and they took 5 quarters to do so (reported sometime in March-May 2010). More amazingly their share prices soared 4-10x (doubled that of profit growth), peaking in July 7 2010 (despite FDA approving the H1N1 vaccine in September 2009); hence, this goes to show that share prices are strongly correlated with quarterly profit trend.

















































































As for Covid, this began in December 2019 and is still ongoing; no vaccine has been found and approved yet. That said, we have only witness 1 quarter of glove sector earnings performance and it was already mind blowing: 

(i) Top Glove tripled; 
(ii) Supermax doubled whilst; 
(iii) Hartalega unfortunately fell 5%. 

Based on our findings, consensus is looking at explosive earnings growth of 2-5x (at peak levels) while the most bullish analyst in town is estimating 3-9x increase. However, share prices only jumped 2-5x unlike during H1N1 where it doubled that of earnings growth; this clearly suggest that glove stocks potentially still have legs to run further. Moreover, valuations look attractive:

1. Top Glove is trading at 18x P/E vs 5-year average of 22x. When we take the EPS of the most bullish analyst, P/E is only 11x.

2. Supermax is trading at 24x P/E vs 5-year average of 14x. At glance appear demanding but if we use the EPS of the most bullish analyst, P/E drops to 16x while for the broker that estimated RM1b profit, P/E is seen to drop to only 9x.


3. Hartalega is trading at 46x P/E vs 5-year average of 32x. Again, it would fall to 28x if we use the EPS of the most bullish analyst.


Thus, we believe the recent selldown presents a good opportunity to consider accumulating; this is in spite of the concerns of windfall tax and massive capacity expansion of peers in China. 

1. Historical Valuation and Future Earnings

Firstly, we feel consensus is a little too conservative (2-5x) and should play catch up to the earnings projection of the most bullish analyst (3-9x); this is because the impact of Covid-19 is far more profound than H1N1 but consensus is forecasting only similar earnings growth profile (2-4x). Hence, assuming the windfall tax is to shave some 20% of profit projected by the most bullish analyst, P/E for Top Glove, Supermax & Hartalega is estimated to rise to 14x, 11x & 35x, respectively; when compared against historical average, valuation of Top Glove & Supermax still appear to be inexpensive.

2. The Rising Might of China

As for the massive capacity expansion by Chinese peers, it will take more than the course of 2 years. Building an automated technology driven manufacturing facility is not the same as building a makeshift hospitals in 10 days. Certifications, compliance with FDA, global audit / scrutiny / need for transparency are all prerequisite to become a global supplier of gloves. Additionally, our local glove players will also have similar plans and should be able to defend their market shares. Besides, a prolonged trade war with the US may not bode so well for Chinese players. Europe, US, Australia (G7) have taken a very protective stance against the rise of China resulting in distrust, tariff wars and propaganda attacks. Therefore, all in all, we are not overly disturbed with what they are attempting to achieve.

3.  Change in Behavioral Pattern / New Normal

We think after the Covid-19 episode, the awareness of good hygiene has increased and will further support the demand for gloves. Moreover, the % of glove cost to total healthcare expenditure is relatively insignificant. Thus, glove prices may hold better than what most people think after Covid-19. 



After considering all of the above, it is too premature to call it game over for the glove sector. Currently, there are only a handful of industries that can depict strong visible earnings growth. Furthermore, there are fears of a 2nd wave of Covid-19. Overall, consensus has a TP of RM20.28 (most bullish analyst: RM25) for Top Glove, RM8.22 (most bullish analyst: RM11) for Supermax & RM11.58 (most bullish analyst: RM17.50) for Hartalega. For us, we would not bet against these Malaysian industrialist who managed to put Malaysia on a global limelight. Of course this is our humble view, now it is your move.

Supernormal rubber glove demand over next two years
By Ayisy Yusof - June 19, 2020 @ 11:17am
KUALA LUMPUR: Acute supply and supernormal demand of rubber gloves could persist over the next two years, Kenanga Research said.
Its analyst Raymond Choo Ping Khoon said glove makers had received orders for new users including airlines, restaurants, retail apparel chains and hotel operators.
""If we look at the capacity expansion numbers in isolation, it looks overwhelming. Juxtaposed against the annual demand growth and new pandemic-led demand, the additional capacity is not a concern,"" Choo said in a report today.
He said the estimated new yearly capacity may not actually start as scheduled and hence the supply shortage will continue to be acute in 2021.
Choo said on average, two to three plants were required annually for glove makers to meet the supernormal demand, which take between 12 and 24 months to complete.
""We conclude that the average selling price (ASP) tightness will continue going into 2021. We highlight that rumours of a player in China ramping up capacity by 30 billion pieces over two to three years appears absurd which typically takes eight to 10 years to build,"" he said.
Choo noted that Top Glove Corp Bhd stock had veen down 15 per cent in the past few days.
This was due to the alleged ill treatment towards foreign workers, fears of oversupply and rumours of windfall tax, which Kenanga Research believes, had been largely overplayed.
""The stock is currently trading at undemanding price-earnings-ration valuation of slightly above mean at 21 times compared to earnings growth averaging 130 per cent for the financial year 2020 (FY20) and 2021 (FY21).""
Kenanga Research maintained Top Glove target price of RM25 per share and reiterated an ""outperform"" call on the stock.
The firm said strong management, booming gloves market due to the pandemic and solid earnings growth averaging 130 per per annum for FY20 and FY21 would support the call for Top Glove.
However, a key risk to its call include lower-than-expected volume sales and ASP.
""We highlight that Top Glove's ASP for months of June to August is higher by 15 per cent month-on-month, indicating supply tightness.
""With a diverse customer base, we expect Top Glove to have better pricing power and hence potentially higher-than-expected industry average prices,"" he added.
Top Glove recently highlighted that 20 per cent of its new capacity would be allocated to spot price, between US$80 and US$100 for 1,000 pieces.

__________________________________________________________





Dear all, apart from Riverstone Holdings Ltd. which I was the earliest to discover and highlight the stock, I have yet to write an article on the glove sector due to a proliferation of articles / reports by research analysts , authors and promoters which made me feel writing another article is redundant. However, given the selldown in glove sector in recent days since Top Glove reported extraordinary results, I would like to share my humble view with all. (A detailed article would follow later on)

When I first called Riverstone Holdings in 2019, I remembered it was only 90 sens SGD, today it closed $2.31 SGD (high of $2.49). I have not sold a single share since then. Why did I choose this company? Some may ask, if I was so good, why did I fail to notice other gloves stocks like the big 4 and only focused on Riverstone? Bear with me and let me share a true story. 



Luck was on my side when I was representing a client (US buyer of medical gloves) during their visit to Malaysia scouting for suppliers. They wanted Top Glove even before visiting other glove makers thinking Topglove is number 1. However they later on realised in terms of quality, Tier 1 nitrile medical gloves were Hartalega, (lesser known) Riverstone, (non-listed) YTY Group. Through this business dealing, I had the chance to visit Riverstone manufacturing facility, meet with the management team. I knew I had to invest after my visit because I was impressed with their facility and most importantly the management team / founder philosophy. This was before Covid-19 pandemic. 

Shortly after that, I started studying the sector and found :

1. Hartalega - would always command a premium over the rest (founder Mr Kuan - is an industry titan / pioneer) with strong balance sheet and state of the art facility / technology. 

2. Top Glove is the ever expanding, aggressive, high profile number 2 chasing Hartalega market leader (market cap) position. What made me hesitant was the huge debts taken to expand - perpetual sukuk. I never liked overly aggressive business philosophy. However, today Topglove is reaping the full benefit due to their aggressive growth model. 

3. Kossan was the number 3, steady, expanding with good margin glove player who was not as aggressive as Topglove but reliable and willing to work hard to fulfil their OEM client needs whilst carving their own niche is technical gloves. 

4. Supermax was the OBM player who had fluctuating performance, and margin that was lower with a less healthy balance sheet. Today, Supermax OBM model is paying off benefiting from full ASP increase. 




When Covid-19 was still known as Novel Coronavirus in end Jan and before a full blown pandemic, during a round of golf, a seasoned investor whom I was having a game with told me to buy Supermax. The price was RM1.70 then. I refused as my biggest reservation was the past political issues of the founder. Clearly, I was wrong.

Subsequently, when Riverstone results was out, I knew that this sector is due for rerating. Then the glove stocks started the run and I was desperately looking for the next glove stock still a laggard as Big 3 were shooting through the roof. Luckily, I found Sri Trang Agro (Thailand and Singapore dual listed) both were still significantly undervalued. I took a huge position. My subscribers did too and today, all are sitting on good profits from Riverstone and Sri Trang. We are still holding till today.


I wanted to be patient to wait for results earnings before I make a call which is my style.I couldn't believe how crazy the sector rerated as retailers, research analysts and promoters were pushing Big 4 and other lesser known / loss making glove players. To me it has become like a ""Tuilp Mania"". But I was wrong when Top Glove released the results last week. It was off the charts. They were right. 


Now fast forward to today, the entire sector appears to be facing sell off due to a variety of reasons. I won't address it here one by one but will deal with it in a later article. I will only say this - the gloves sector retracement / selloff is a godsend opportunity to those who missed the ride. Whoever entered earlier and is taking profit now, congratulations, you or the fund did well hence taking profit off the table is good discipline. 

BUT, this is a good opportunity to collect Topglove, Supermax, Kossan and Hartalega (in order of position) because fundamentally, this will be a record run never seen in our history and it is a culmination of 30-40 years since the industry was built by the pioneers back when there were over 300 players competing. What you see today are the reward being reaped after years of innovation, persistence, competition by these manufacturers who built their business on solid foundation that even China manufacturers with their skilled copycat / technology innovation cannot compete. Malaysia glove sector is an industry that controls 65% of world market share not by sheer luck or opportunistic play. It is years of organic growth backed by natural resources, technology innovation, R&D which has won the trust, certification and global reputation for the country. 

This is my view and I hope it will clear some of the confusion / anxiety / worry faced by my fellow investors. Rather than throw your money into syndicated promoted goreng stocks with poor fundamentals, have a little faith in our Malaysian industrialist who have toiled and sweat more than 30 years to play a big role in fighting covid-19 global pandemic and protecting frontliners with their products. Their valuation is more than justified and I believe this is one of the best opportunities in the market right now.

    KUALA LUMPUR (June 18): Glove counters hit yet another speed bump today, leaving some anxious investors wondering if the rally in these stocks has lost steam.
Top Glove Corp Bhd was the biggest loser on the FBM KLCI, dropping RM1 or 6.37% to RM14.76 while Hartalega Holdings Bhd fell 3.69% or 44 sen to RM11.50.
Of the other two big players, Kossan Rubber Industries Bhd dropped 5.36% or 45 sen to RM7.95 while Supermax Corp Bhd declined 3.88% or 28 sen to RM6.39.
The smaller cap glove makers were not spared as well, with Careplus Group Bhd dropping 4.51% to RM1.27, Rubberex Corp Bhd falling 4.55% to RM2.73 and Comfort Gloves Bhd closing 0.37% lower at RM2.72.
As a result, the Bursa Malaysia Healthcare Index was the worst performing index today, closing 71.89 points or 3.2% lower at 2,202.21.
Most of the stock chartists contacted today with regards to the price trend of the glove counters said a near-term pullback is deemed necessary for the next up leg.
EquitiesTracker Holdings Bhd chief market strategist Benny Lee told theedgemarkets that the glove stocks are currently entering a technical pullback, which is fairly normal considering that they are way overbought — their monthly RSI reading currently stands well above the overbought region of 70.
“As investors start to digest the reported quarterly results and start to justify the fundamentals against the sharp move in share prices, this is a very normal pullback. The prices had gone up too fast,” said Lee.
Nevertheless, he said the current retracement could entice strong support, especially if prices drop around 50% from their peak levels, given the prevailing strong interest in the sector on the backdrop of a second wave of COVID-19 infection currently still developing.
Stephen Soo, senior technical analyst at TA Securities Holdings Bhd, concurs that glove stocks are currently entering into a healthy pullback phase after seeing hyperbolic runs in the past weeks.
“Glove counters are entering into consolidation mode probably in the next few weeks, which fits well to building a stronger base to prepare for the next up wave,” he said.
As indicated by the Bollinger Bands indicator in stock charts, Soo said glove stocks could be poised for some further weakness in the near term.
Following their exponential runs, glove stocks have been trading above their upper Bollinger Bands. As such, Soo thinks glove stocks “could still have room to fall in the near term, until their share prices reach the middle band of the Bollinger indicator”.
The Bollinger Bands indicator provides a relative judgement of high and low prices of a stock. By definition, prices are high at the upper band (an indication that they are poised for a pullback) and low at the lower band (boding well for rebounds).
Maybank Investment Bank Bhd senior chartist Nik Ihsan Raja Abdullah thinks that the selling pressure in glove stocks will fade soon and accumulation of these stocks could be considered especially when they reach crucial support levels.
“The prices [of glove stocks] declined on the back of lower trading volume over the past five days, suggesting the current selling pressure has started losing steam. [And hence] we expect the uptrend to continue once the selling pressures fully normalize,” he said.
Nik Ihsan reminded investors to especially consider setting trading stop-losses slightly lower at critical support levels, and watch out for bullish reversal patterns in a shorter time frame.
Key technical support levels for glove stocks
Turning to individual stocks, Nik Ihsan said Top Glove is considered the strongest among all, as the current correction is still regarded as mild, considering that the stock is still trading above the 22-day exponential moving average (EMA) support line of about RM14.
“Negative reading in both Stochastic and MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) suggest further decline although we expect the downside risk potentially to be capped within immediate support zones between RM13.30 and RM14.30,” he said.
As for Harta, he holds the view that the correction for the stock is ongoing as indicated by negative readings in both its Stochastic and MACD.
“The stock is set to test the 22-day EMA line of RM11.20 in the near term and the support at 38.2% Fibonacci Retracement (FR) level of around RM11. Lower support is set at RM10.60, which was the price that the stock gapped up back on May 27.”
FR levels are widely used by stock chartists to determine the key support and resistance levels, and one of the key thresholds is the 38.2% mark.
For Kossan, Nik Ihsan views that minor correction for the stock is still ongoing as it has tumbled below the 22-day EMA line of around RM8.20, despite the RSI reading having now approached oversold territory.
“Next, the stock could test the lower support within 38.2% FR level and the 50-day EMA line in the near term of around RM7.20 to RM7.60,” he said
As for Supermax, the stock is facing stiff challenges towards its current support at the 22-day EMA line of around RM6.70. Should the stock fall below this support level, it could continue to fall toward the 38.2% FR level of around RM6.19.
Moving on to Comfort Gloves, the stock has traded below the 22-day EMA line of RM2.82 on the back of negative readings in both Stochastic and MACD. However, Nik Ihsan thinks the downside risk for the stock could potentially be capped within the 50% FR level and the 50-day EMA line of between RM2.28 and RM2.48.
Lastly, for Careplus Group, Nik Ihsan views that the stock’s current correction could be completed within the 61.8% FR level — slightly below the 22-day EMA line, between RM1.11 and RM1.19.

US: Jobless claims drop much less than expected to 1.508m. A report released by the Labor Department showed a continued decrease in first-time claims for US unemployment benefits in the week ended June 13th, although claims fell by much less than expected. The Labor Department said initial jobless claims dropped to 1.508m, a decrease of 58,000 from the previous week's upwardly revised level of 1.566m. Economists had expected jobless claims to tumble to 1.3m from the 1.542m originally reported for the previous week. Jobless claims fell by much less than anticipated but still pulled back further off the record high of 6.867m set in the week ended March 28th. Noting the latest weekly decrease reflects the smallest decline since claims began retreating from their late March peak, economists at Oxford Economics said, ""The latest jobless claims data reminds us that significant stress remains in the labor market."" The report said the less volatile four-week moving average slid to 1,773,500, a decrease of 234,500 from the previous week's revised average of 2,008,000. (RTT)
US: Leading economic index jumps more than expected in May. After reporting sharp declines in leading US economic indicators in the two previous months, the Conference Board released a report showing its reading on leading indicators rebounded by more than expected in May. The Conference Board said its leading economic index jumped by 2.8% in May after plunging by 6.1% in April and 7.5% in March. Economists had expected the index to climb by 1.7%. The Conference Board noted the rebound by the leading index was primarily due to initial jobless claims pulling back well off the record high set in late March. ""The improvements in labor markets, housing permits, and stock prices also buoyed the LEI, but new orders in manufacturing, consumers' outlook on the economy, and the Leading Credit Index still point to weak economic conditions,"" it said. Itadded, ""The breadth and depth of the decline in the LEI between February and April suggest the economy at large will remain in recession territory in the near term."" The report said the coincident economic index increased by 1.1% in May following the 10.4% nosedive in April. Meanwhile, the Conference Board said the lagging economic index slumped by 1.9% in May after jumping by 1.7% in April. (RTT)
UK: BoE boosts QE; holds record low rate. The BoE announced additional quantitative easing and left its interest rate unchanged at a record low to combat the sharp recession triggered by the coronavirus pandemic. The Monetary Policy Committee decided to raise the size of the asset purchase programme by GBP100bn to GBP745bn. Eight members voted to raise the QE as they judged that a further easing of monetary policy is warranted to meet its statutory objectives, while Chief Economist Andrew Haldane preferred to maintain the programme at GBP645bn. The MPC expects the programme to reach GBP745bn, around the turn of the year. The committee unanimously decided to hold the interest rate at 0.1%, as widely expected. The bank had altogether reduced the rate by 65bps at two unscheduled meetings in March. The need to continue supporting the economy will undoubtedly fuel further discussion about whether negative rates are on the horizon. (RTT)
China: Pledges continued economic support but warns of liquidity hangover. China will maintain ample financial system liquidity in the 2H of the year as the economy recovers from the coronavirus but will need to consider withdrawing that support at some point, its central bank governor warned. The comments signal policymakers' concerns that the monetary stimulus unleashed in recent months to help firms through the pandemic could add to debt risks in the world's second-largest economy. The pledge on continued support helped China's stocks rally against a broader decline in global markets. Yi said new loans are likely to hit a record of nearly CNY20trn this year, up from CNY16.81trn in 2019, and total social financing could increase by more than CNY30trn. (New York Times)
India: Plans extra tariffs, trade barriers on 300 imported products from China and elsewhere. India plans to impose higher trade barriers and raise import duties on around 300 products from China and elsewhere, as part of an effort to protect domestic businesses. The plan has been under review since at least April and is in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's recently announced self-reliance campaign to promote local products. The new duty structures are likely to be gradually outlined over the next three months, said the sources. The government is considering raising import duties on 160-200 products and imposing non-tariff barriers — such as licensing requirements or stricter quality checks — on another 100, according to the officials. (Reuters)
Indonesia: Central bank makes year’s 3 rd rate cut, trim GDP outlook. Indonesia's central bank delivered its third cut to the benchmark rate this year, stepping up support for Southeast Asia's largest economy as it struggles to avoid a recession amid the broadening fallout of the coronavirus pandemic. Bank Indonesia (BI) cut the 7-day reverse repurchase rate by 25bps to 4.25%, the lowest since 2018, as predicted by the majority of economists in a Reuters poll. The move came a few days after the finance minister warned of recession risks, with GDP expected to shrink by 3.1% in the 2Q20 — the first contraction since 1999 — and possibly contract again in the following three months. Governor Perry Warjiyo pledged to keep all of BI's instruments ""accommodative"" and said there was room for further monetary easing, while trimming BI's outlook for 2020 GDP growth to 0.9%-1.9% from 2.3%.

We believe the confluence of reasons weighing down on the share price for the past few days including alleged ill treatment towards foreign workers, fears of oversupply and rumours of windfall tax have been largely overplayed.

Reiterate Outperform.
Unwarranted 15% decline over the past few days. The stock is down 15% despite the stellar 3QFY20 results announced a week ago. We believe the confluence of reasons weighing down on the share price these past few days such as rumours of windfall tax, ill treatment towards migrant workers and fears of oversupply have been largely overplayed. The issue concerning migrant workers is old news which had been resolved. Previous concerns such as confiscated passports, overdue agent fees and overtime wages have all been addressed. TOPGLOV had since 2019 adhered to international social compliance standards and have over 100 external international standards audit for all its factories. Furthermore, although the issue of windfall tax has been talked about, of which we were not able to verify its veracity, it is pending an official announcement, if any.
Our analysis suggests acute shortage in supply. We have done an analysis to quash any concerns of oversupply. In anticipation of higher demand due to the pandemic, stock piling and new users following the pandemic, players are raising capacities to meet the surging demand. Our analysis (see table overleaf) suggests that acute supply and supernormal demand could persist over the next two years. Interestingly, players are getting orders for new users that include airlines, restaurants, retail apparel chains and hotel operators. If we look at the capacity expansion numbers in isolation, it looks overwhelming. Juxtaposed against the annual demand growth and new pandemic-led demand, the additional capacity is not a concern. In fact, the estimated new yearly capacity may not actually start as scheduled and hence the supply shortage will continue to be acute in 2021. Typically, to cater for normal demand, glove makers essentially need to build just one plant per year. However, from channel checks, to cater for this current pandemic-driven demand, two to three plants are required for each glove maker (on average) annually in order to meet the supernormal demand, which take between 12 to 24 months to complete. Hence, we conclude that ASP tightness will continue going into 2021. We highlight that rumours of a player in China ramping up capacity by 30b pieces over 2-3 years appears absurd which typically takes 8 to 10 years to build.
Strong prospects ahead. We highlight that TOPGLOV’s ASP for months of June to Aug is higher by 15% m-o-m further indicating supply tightness. In the 3QFY20 results teleconference, management highlighted that 20% of new capacity will be allocated to spot price which is between USD80 to USD100/1,000 pieces. With a diverse customer base, we expect TOPLGOV to have better pricing power and hence potentially higher-than-expected industry average prices
Reiterate OP. TP is RM25.00 based on unchanged 36x CY21E EPS of 69.20 sen (at slightly above +2.0SD above 5-year historical forward mean). Its merits are: (i) strong management, (ii) the booming gloves market due to the pandemic, and (iii) solid earnings growth averaging 130% per annum for FY20 and FY21 compared to PERs of 32x and 21x, respectively.
A key risk to our call is lower-than-expected volume sales and ASP.

Top Glove denies worker exploitation claims in British TV report
PETALING JAYA: Top Glove today said a Channel 4 News video that purportedly uncovered migrant worker exploitation and slack social distancing measures was “highly inaccurate”.
The investigation by the UK-based channel was aired on Tuesday and allegedly revealed poor living conditions in cramped hostels, with up to 24 workers per room.
Channel 4 News also accused Top Glove, the world’s largest rubber glove manufacturer, of making illegal deductions from workers’ salaries and failing to properly enforce social distancing at its factories, hostels and transport facilities – with workers fearful of catching Covid-19 as a result.
“Every employee’s safety, health and wellbeing has always been of utmost importance to Top Glove, all the more during this Covid-19 era,” said William Yap, Top Glove’s general manager of human resources.
“We are committed to adhering to internationally recognised standards in our social compliance practices. Since January 2019, we have attended to more than 100 international external audits at Top Glove’s factories.
“The positive outcomes of audits, such as those conducted by SMETA and the Business Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI), reflect excellent progress in our social compliance, where concentrated efforts were made to enhance our labour practices comprehensively to meet stringent international requirements,” he added in a statement.
In an e-mail to FMT, Top Glove also attached a copy of a report by the health ministry, dated May 5, which stated that the company’s Factory 9 in Klang followed guidelines set out in the Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases Act 1988 in a manner that was “very satisfactory”.
The company said other relevant authorities, such as the international trade and investment ministry (Miti) and the Department of Labour had also conducted visits and spot checks at Top Glove’s factories and workers’ accommodation to confirm “optimum compliance” with standard operating procedures.
Channel 4 also alleged some workers at Top Glove’s factories had to clock up to 111 hours in overtime per month as the company tried to meet increased production targets during the Covid-19 pandemic, which has seen a surge in demand for rubber gloves and surgical gloves.
Top Glove last week announced record profits of RM348 million for the third quarter ending May 31, 2020, a 365% year-on-year increase and a 202% quarter-on-quarter rise.
Top Glove, which has 45 factories, has 19,000 employees and produces 78.7 billion gloves each year."

Latexx Partners up for sale, Top Glove & MQTech are ""frontrunners""
June 18, 2020 @ 2:15pm
Latexx Partners has manufacturing facilities at Kamunting Industrial Estate in Perak. NSTP/WEB
NST Business
KUALA LUMPUR: Rubber glove manufacturer Latexx Partners Bhd is being sold by its
Austrian-based parent Semperit AG.
In is understood that Latexx Partners, which was delisted from Bursa Malaysia in June 2013 following its takeover by rubber and plastic products maker Semperit, would be sold for about RM300 million.
Top Glove Corp Bhd and MQ Technology Bhd (MQTech) have emerged as the frontrunners to be the new owner of Latexx Partners.
Latexx Partners has manufacturing facilities at Kamunting Industrial Estate in Perak.
It was taken private by Semperit at RM2.30 per piece and its warrant at RM1.77 in 2013.
The takeover had then made Semperit the world's second largest rubber glove manufacturer after Top Glove.
Latexx Partners subsidiaries are Latexx Manufacturing Sdn Bhd, which manufactures rubber gloves, Medtexx Manufacturing Sdn Bhd, which is engaged in the trading of rubber gloves and letting of glove manufacturing plant and machinery, Total Glove Company Sdn Bhd, which treats and processes natural rubber latex examination and surgical gloves, and Worldmed Manufacturing Sdn Bhd, which trades rubber gloves.
Semperit, which was founded in 1824, is located in Vienna with its global R&D centre in Wimpassing, lower Austria.
The group employs around 6,900 people worldwide, including close to 3,600 in Asia and about 900 in Austria.
A source said Top Glove was the top contender to buy Latexx Partner, given the vast resources of the company which boasts some RM42 billion in market capitalisation.
Alternatively, a cash payout plus issuance of new shares of a much smaller company like MQTech could be a wiser choice for Semperit.
Amid the Covid-19 pandemic, the source said MQTech had been eyeing the medical gloves industry and it believed the sector would continue to be profitable in the long run.
""The Latexx Partners deal was also pitched to MQTech recently, and a positive outcome could be out within days,"" the source added.
MQTech is listed on Bursa Malaysia's ACE Market.
It manufactures products of rapid tooling, prototyping, jigs, dyes development, and other manufacturing solutions.
The company also manufactures high precision magnetic coils, coil assemblies, precision metal plates and jigs and fixtures used in the manufacture of hard disk drives, automotive and medical industries.
MQTech supplies goods and services to Asia Pacific and Southeast Asia.

However, the full extent of ASP pricing potential and ad hoc sales mix will be realised in the coming quarters. Meanwhile, channel checks suggest ASPs have reached a ceiling at US$160-175/’000 pieces.
Despite valuations surging over the recent months, we believe they have yet to fairly price in an impending earnings windfall.
Maintain OVERWEIGHT.
Top pick: Top Glove
Rubber Glove Makers' 1Q20 Results Round-up
Sector earnings came in well above expectations across the board. Sector top-line grew 18.2% q-o-q on the back of higher volume growth of 12.9% q-o-q, primarily on Top Glove reaching its utilisation limit and destocking of its inventory. ASPs for the period were only marginally higher at 0.9% q-o-q as glove producers’ ASP remained locked in and were unable to benefit from the disproportionate demand surge. The RM/US$ was largely unchanged (+0.4% q-o-q).
Sector EBITDA margin improved considerably on:
higher economies of scale;
higher ASPs; and
lower raw materials costs with nitrile (-6.6%) more than offsetting latex cost (+3.4%).
Against improved margins, core earnings outpaced revenue growth, at 89.1% q-o-q.
On the Brink of Unprecedented Windfall Earnings
Over the coming quarters, we expect to see a step change in blended ASPs. After having largely locked in ASPs until April, glove producers are repricing its ASPs upwards on a monthly basis while raising ad hoc sales mix, which commands up to 3x the usual ASP.
Furthermore, costs of raw materials (nitrile and latex) have dipped further by 6.6% and 0.9% q-o-q in 2Q20 respectively. However, beyond 2Q20, we expect raw materials costs to recover off multi-year lows and for glove producers to share a fraction of their windfall earnings with their suppliers.
Maintain OVERWEIGHT
We also believe elevated demand could well sustain ASPs up to 2Q21, largely underpinning our 2021 earnings outlook.
Our OVERWEIGHT is premised on:
multi-fold valuation gains have yet to fully factor in the impending earnings surge over the quarters ahead;
sustained glove demand over 2021; and
scarcity of safe haven earnings growth (2-year earnings CAGR of 123% in 2019-21) as most other sectors face multitude of headwinds.
Our top pick for the sector is Top Glove. We also highlight Supermax as a major beneficiary of the glove ASP surge.
Supermax: Super Strategy to Maximise Profit
We highlight Supermax as we believe it is by far the best beneficiary of the recent surge in demand for gloves.
Supermax with its OBM model could be an underappreciated diamond.
Unlike Hartalega, Top Glove and Kossan which are predominantly OEMs,Supermax has toiled for years to establish its own brand and distribution channels. The benefits are coming to fruition with the surge in ASPs. It currently commands ASPs of close to US$160-175/’000 pieces vs US$150 in May and US$90 pre-COVID period.
We gather there is limited upside to current ASPs as various government agencies have implemented redirecting of personal protective equipment (PPE) supplies of close to US$160-175/’000 pieces. That said, Supermax does receive urgent ad hoc orders in the range of US$190/’000 pcs.
OBM alongside its own distribution network fully captures elevated ASPs.
Apart from its OBM model, Supermax uniquely distributes its own products as well which makes up close to 55% of overall volume and derives the best margins of up to 700-800% at the gross profit level (based on current prices). Meanwhile, sales through third-party distributors command about 400% margins.
Since the COVID-19 outbreak, Supermax has strived hard to increase its sales exposure through these two channels (to 95% of volume mix from 70% previously) to fully capitalise the disproportionate spike in demand to maximise its earnings. With these established advantages, it allows Supermax to be a far superior beneficiary of elevated ASPs relative to the likes of Top Glove.
Most aggressive capacity expansion among Big 4 producers.
Aside from commanding margins in excess of peers, Supermax’s capacity expansion amid the windfall earnings is ahead of peers as well at 21.5% CAGR over 2019-21. Top Glove is close behind at 19.7% while Hartalega’s and Kossan’s capacity expansions are limited as available space has been exhausted.
By end-22, Supermax is due to usurp Kossan in terms of capacity. Apart from that, its capacity is dedicated to nitrile production.
No change to dividend payout but distribution of treasury shares instead...
Supermax is not looking to increase its dividend payout although it anticipates windfall earnings for the year. However, it is looking to distribute its treasury shares as dividend-in-kind instead. It has 68.9m treasury shares, translating into a 5% yield.
…to finance its capacity expansion and maintain a robust balance sheet.
Supermax’s addition of close to 20b pieces annually in capacity to its existing capacity of 21.8b pieces over the next 3-4 years would translate to close to RM1b capex. Therefore, to preserve its balance sheet and maintain its net gearing at 0.2x, it necessitates a conservative dividend payout despite the windfall earnings.
Higher raw materials costs going forward despite lower underlying prices.
Latex and nitrile costs for Supermax fell 6.6% and 0.1% q-o-q in 4QFY20 respectively. However, going forward, management expects overall raw materials including packaging and chemicals to cost ~10% higher amid lower underlying prices as Supermax looks to trickle down some windfall earnings to its suppliers.
Appears to have well beaten consensus.
Based on Supermax’s ASPs and product mix, it appears Supermax could significantly beat consensus expectations of RM395m and the highest projected earnings of RM561m.
Supermax’s valuations could normalise sharply to single-digit PE.
With the surge in earnings, Supermax’s one-year forward PE could normalise sharply to single-digit PE. It would trade at a significant laggard to peers. We believe Hartalega, Top Glove and Kossan should be trading at 45.0x, 23.5x and 23.0x PE to their respective financial year ends.
Other potential catalysts include being part of the FBMKLCI Index in Nov 20 should a vaccine be not discovered by then.
Top Glove Corporation - BUY/Target: RM21.90
Our target price is based on 23.5x 2021F PE, or -0.5 SD of its 3-year forward PE mean. We believe valuations should be at a slight discount to its historical PE mean as it is:-
being pegged to windfall peak earnings,
upside to earnings have mostly been factored in, and
the risk-to-reward at this juncture is increasingly pronounced given the surge in Top Glove Share Price.
That said, our PE peg is reasonable given Top Glove is an established FBMKLCI component index constituent and its sublime earnings growth. ASPs are being adjusted 15% m-o-m while lofty ad-hoc prices may represent upside surprise to our earnings. These translate into a 2-year CAGR of 218% (FY19-21F).
Furthermore, its explosive q-o-q earnings growth over the subsequent 2-3 quarters should catalyse its valuations going forward.
(Using the latest FX rate of RM1 to SGD0.326, we derive target price of 7.14 in SGD term)
Kossan Rubber Industries (KRI MK) - BUY/Target: RM10.95
Our target price is based on 23x 2020F PE, or +1SD of its 3-year mean PE. We believe improved visibility over Kossan’s ASP revision is likely to catalyse its valuations going forward. On a q-o-q basis, we expect 2Q20 ASPs to potentially improve by up to a high-single-digit growth rate. 2H20 is expected to see a steep step change in ASPs.
Aside from that, Kossan sees firm demand visibility up till 1Q21. It is allocating 15% of volume to meet ad-hoc demand, potentially commanding a premium of 3x usual ASPs. This translates into an attractive 2-year earnings CAGR of 73% over 2019-21).
Hartalega Holdings (HART MK) - HOLD/Target: RM12.95
Our target price is based on an unchanged 45.0x 2021F PE, or its +2SD of its 3-year forward PE mean. The premium can be justified by Hartelega’s strong operating efficiency under ordinary circumstances and innovation ahead of peers. Aside from that, the Next Generation Manufacturing Complex (NGC) 2.0 provides visibility over medium-term growth.
Nevertheless, our HOLD call is premised on Hartalega’s valuations being priced in at this juncture, which limits potential price upside. Entry price is RM11.50.
Risk
Discovery of a vaccine and/or treatment could cause negative newsflow, however, as we have previously highlighted, scaling of global manufacturing to achieve herd immunity may take 12 months and beyond. Aside from that, peak mass testing may translate into lower glove demand as well.
Downside risks are spikes in raw materials costs, a strengthening ringgit, sharp ASP reversion and COVID-19 outbreak among the production workforce. Upside risks are supply disruption to the broader industry and a strengthening US$.

KEEP BUYING - gloveharicut | I3investor,https://klse.i3investor.com/blogs/gloveharicut/2020-06-17-story-h1508842898-CIMB_s_view_on_glove_KEEP_BUYING.jsp,"I read this good post from fca70jia in topglove forum and I am reproducing it to my blog.
  The smart CIMB analyst hit a jackpot
During H1N1, average orderbook was 4-5 months at max, and Malaysian glove makers enjoyed a minimum of 5 quarters of strong glove demand. Hence, we should expect at least 8-9 quarters of strong glove demand based on current order visibility of more than 1 year plus.
  CIMB's view on glove...

Sector in focus: Rubber Gloves

Recommendation: Overweight

Top picks: Top Glove (TOPG MK, Add, TP:RM 25.00) & Supermax (SUCB MK, Add, TP:RM 9.80)
Other calls: Kossan (KRI MK, Add, TP: RM11.50) & Hartalega (HART MK, Add, TP: RM14.60)

Key highlights:
Share prices of glove counters particularly, Top Glove and Supermax declined by double digits yesterday. In my view, this is unwarranted. I have also received a lot of enquiries on the reasons why glove counters were being sold down, and whether there has been: i) any fundamental changes, ii) weakening of Dow Jones and iii) massive profit taking on these stocks.

Comments:
1) Based on channel checks as recent as yesterday, there has been no fundamental changes to the glove sector
a. Vaccine rumors still persist, but there has not one there has gone beyond clinical trials. Everything else remains as speculation at this juncture, with any potential vaccine are only ready for mass production by mid-next year (trust me, I cover healthcare stocks too!).
b. Quantity and prices of ah-hoc orders continue to increase (more glove makers are allocating higher percentage of capacity for spot orders) and order visibility remains solid for glove makers (12-14 months).
c. ASPs hikes are still on the cards (ASPs increases are likely to be up to 1QCY20), with more orders being received in preparation for 2nd wave of Covid-19 in various countries.
d. Near-term earnings outlook remains beyond solid, with glove makers likely to post record-breaking profits in the next 2-3 quarters at the very least. In fact, recent noises suggest that some earnings forecast for certain companies are too conservative.

2) If we just zoom into yesterday’s share price data, Malaysia glove makers suffered big declines in share prices while share prices of China-based glove makers appreciated by 7-10% yesterday. Singapore glove makers retreated slightly today by 1.7-1.9%. Based on data from the past 7 days, Malaysia glove makers are the only ones having negative share price performances (-7.3% to -32%), while share prices of Singapore glove makers still appreciated slightly (+0.4% to +5.3%).

3) As a matter of fact, we understand that there has been an increase in enquirers for more glove orders (spot and recurring) given concerns of wave 2 of Covid-19. This is given concerns of occurrence of more Covid-19 cases with re-opening of schools and businesses on a global basis. We have begun to see a re-spike in cases in China, US, Russia, Brazil and etc. (While things are normalizing in Malaysia, cases of Covid-19 on a global scale are in fact increasing and not declining)

4) Based on our earnings forecasts, glove stocks valuations have retreated to a level which we believe are very attractive (TOPG is trading at 13.6x CY21 P/E while SUCB is trading at 19.7x CY21 P.E – Both companies are expected to post at least 200-300% yoy growth in FY21 net profit). I believe glove stocks are attractive as they are trading at teen P/E, and have 200-300% yoy earnings growth.

5) Take note that our earnings forecast have yet to account for any surge in gloves due to Wave 2. On average, our earnings forecast for glove companies are accounting for ASPs increase up to end-CY20, flat in 1HCY21 with a decline from 3QCY21 onwards.

6) Will glove ASPs and demand for glove fall off the cliff? Long and short answer is a definite NO.

During H1N1, average orderbook was 4-5 months at max, and Malaysian glove makers enjoyed a minimum of 5 quarters of strong glove demand. Hence, we should expect at least 8-9 quarters of strong glove demand based on current order visibility of more than 1 year plus.

While we expect ASPs to fall when supply-demand of gloves is more balanced (likely when order visibility is below 4-6 months), but i believe that ASPs of gloves will never go back to 18-22USD per 1000 pieces. This is like expecting face mask prices to go back to 18 sen per piece in 2HCY19 compared to RM0.80-1.50 per piece currently (China masks which has no quality standard being dumped at 50-60 cents per piece – this cannot happen in glove sector, as gloves are used in healthcare sector which requires FDA approval). (Bear in mind, face mask machines can be bought off the shelves, but building glove plants including installation of production lines need 18-24 months to reach a certain standard produce gloves with FDA-approved quality)

7) There is a fundamental change happening for the glove sector, leading to positive trends in the long term. I.e. Better healthcare awareness, more glove usage in more industries, higher usage of gloves per capita in more countries. Hence, glove ASPs will never go back to 18-22USD per 1000 pieces, with recurring usage driving higher consumption patterns."

I checked with my Remissier and I share this in my post.
  It is simple estimation by factor in
The capacity growth
ASP growth
  Capacity
TOPGLOV increase 7% total capacity & the capacity usage increase from 95% to 100%
To make the calculation simple, capacity increment = 5% + 7% = 12%
  ASP
80% capacity - ASP increase 15% every month from Jun to Aug = 30% increase.
20% capacity - It will sell based on spot price i.e. more than 100% increase.
ASP increase = 80% * 30% + 20% * 100% =44%
  Q4 Profit = 1 Billion?
I use Q3 Revenue as the base
  Q3 Revenue = 1.688B
Q4 Revenue = Q3 Revenue x Capacity growth x ASP growth = 1.688B x 1.12 x 1.44 = 2.72B
  The smartest Uncle Koon pointed out correctly in his post: It did not cost our company anything to increase the selling price. The additional selling price was pure profit.
Q4 margin = Q3 margin + ASP increase = 20% + 44% = 66%
Well you may said company need to reward staff & increase expenses when make good money. OK, use Q4 margin = 40%
  Q4 Profit = 2.72B x 40% = 1 Billion
    Target Price: Above RM30
Topglov should able to deliver a better FY2021 because (1) Capacity growth another 20% (2) increment of the ASP until 2021.
The most pessimistic estimation: FY21 net profit = 1 Billion x 4 Quarter = 4 Billon
Peg it wth PE20, the lowest TOPGLOV market cap = 80 Billion (Target Price : RM30)
  The smart analyst will upgrade the Price target when they see clearer picture.

  During zoom webinar, Tan Sri Lim share this information.
Top Glove Corporation Bhd expects better earnings in its current year ending 2020 (FY20) backed by the recent rise in ad hoc and spot orders by government agencies and global market demand. 
It sales would likely double in its current fourth quarter, driven by higher average selling prices (ASP).
It is now guiding for a monthly double-digit ASP increase at least for the next few months.
Top Glove envisions ""extremely"" robust quarters ahead, driven by strong demand growth, high utilisation and additional capacity coming onstream.
Following the increase in glove demand from virtually every country in the world, the group's utilisation rate rose from a pre-Covid level of 85 per cent to above 95 per cent in Q3.
Demand backed by increased usage in both the medical and non-medical sectors, as well as heightened hygiene awareness

Top Glove's strong 3QFY20 net profit beat expectations on the higher operating leverage.
Post-revision, Top Glove trades at CY21 P/E of 18x (below its mean of 19x).
We believe Top Glove will continue to re-rate on the ASP hikes momentum and COVID-19 second wave. Maintain BUY.
Results Beat Ours and Street’s Expectations
Top Glove's 3QFY20 net profit of MYR348m (+3x q-o-q, +4.7x y-o-y) brought 9MFY20 net profit to MYR575m (+98% y-o-y) and accounted for 51%/63% of our/street’s full-year estimates. Results were above our expectation as we expect ASP hikes-led net profit of MYR782m in 4QFY20 (+2.2x q-o-q, +9.8x y-o-y).
A first interim DPS of 10sen was declared (+2.9x y-o-y).
3QFY20: Record EBITDA Margin of 28%
Top Glove's 3QFY20 revenue (+37% q-o-q) was driven by a higher sales volume (+25% q-o-q), a higher blended ASP (+5% q-o-q) and a higher USD/MYR (+5% q-o-q). However, net profit growth (+3x q-o-q) was much higher than the revenue growth with its EBITDA margin jumped to 28% (+11.8-ppt q-o-q, +15.6-ppt y-o-y) on:
A lower raw material cost (NBR: -10% q-o-q, latex: -1% q-o-q);
Higher operating leverage as the plant utilisation rate was > 95% (2QFY20: 85%) and management targets 100% going forward.
Bullish Guidance From Management
Top Glove management guided for ASP hikes of +15% m-o-m in June-Aug and spot orders to account for 20% of its volume. Even if vaccine is successfully developed, management remains confident that the demand will be solid in 2021 on stock replenishment activities and the emergence of new glove users.
Our FY20-22E EPS is raised by 20%/8%/27% as we:
raise our sales volume growth by 6%/18%/22% given its faster capacity growth;
reduce our blended ASP assumptions by 3%/6% in FY20-21E;
reduce our distributions and selling, administrative and overhead costs to account for the higher operating leverage.
Our ASP Assumptions
Management guided that there has been no pushback on its ASP hikes as the supply is scarce. We also understand that some customers even booked its capacity until Dec 2020 at spot price of USD60-75/k pieces (+2-2.5x higher than the normal orders). To the customers, the priority is to secure supply and the price has become secondary. Management expects spot sales to account for 20% of its total sales volume, underpinned by its new capacity.
To reflect management’s latest guidance, we now assume for ASP hikes of 15% m-o-m for June-Aug and ASP hikes of 5% m-o-m for Sep-Nov 2020. Based on our estimates, Top Glove’s ASPs for the exam gloves would almost double by Nov 2020 (from pre-COVID 19 level in Feb). We have also lowered our spot price assumption from USD100/k pieces to a more sustainable level of USD60/k pieces.
To be conservative and to impute for the potential oversupply risk, we assume for the ASP to drop 5-10% q-o-q in 2Q- 4QFY21E as well as zero spot orders in 2Q-4QFY21E (refer figure 2 in PDF report attached below). We now project for its blended ASP to grow 15%/31% in FY20-21E and to drop 31% in FY22E.

Pricing has improved on m-o-m basis in 4QFY20; setting up for another impressive quarter ahead.
Order book has extended up to 420 days from 30-40 days prior to outbreak; ramping up expansion plans.
Reiterate BUY with Target Price of RM18.45 on positive earnings outlook.
Top Glove's 3QFY20 within expectations.
Top Glove registered a record net profit of RM347.9m in 3QFY20 (+365.9% y-o-y; +200.7% q-o-q), bringing 9MFY20 net profit to RM575m (+98.0% y-o-y). The impressive results were driven by stronger sales volume and average selling price (ASP) as well as lower raw material prices. The results were within our expectations; we anticipate stronger 4QFY20 results.
Top Glove declared an interim first single-tier interim DPS of 10 sen in 3QFY20 (vs 3.5 sen in 3QFY19), translating into a yield of 0.6%. We expect a final dividend of 9.7 sen, with a total payout ratio of 50% (same as FY19’s).
Result Review
Record-high revenue and net profit.
Top Glove's 3QFY20 revenue came in at RM1,688m (+41.8% y-o-y, +37.3% q-o-q), supported by higher sales volume (+24% y-o-y, +25% q-o-q) and higher ASP (+9% y-o-y, +5% q-o-q). The quantum of net profit improvement was greater than that of revenue growth, thanks to lower raw material prices. Natural rubber and natural butadiene prices were down q-o-q and y-o-y in 3QFY20.
Sharp improvement in Aspion’s performance.
Aspion continued to positively contribute to group earnings. It registered a profit before tax (PAT) of RM34.3m in 3QFY20 vs RM6.4m in 2QFY20 and RM6.3m in 1QFY20. For 9MFY20, PAT of RM47.0m had far exceeded PAT of RM10.2m in FY19. The strong results were supported by higher production utilisation rate of 70% and increase in ASP.
Stronger EBIT/k gloves.
EBIT/k gloves came in at RM24.43 (+232.1% y-o-y, +127.0% q-o-q). The significant improvement in EBIT/k was mainly due to the higher ASP and low raw material prices.
Outlook
Expect another impressive quarter ahead.
We gather that pricing increased by 15% on a m-o-m basis in 4QFY20 on the back of robust demand. Moreover, 20% of total capacity was on spot prices in 4QFY20, which was higher than the usual ASP.
Utilisation rate is expected to stay high at 95% vs 85% pre-COVID-19.
Ramping up capacity expansion.
In its latest update in June 2020, the total installed capacity stands at 78.7bn pieces of gloves, +5.3bn pieces of gloves compared to 73.4bn pieces of gloves in March 2020. Management revised the planned capacity expansion upwards for CY20 and CY21 in order to capture the robust demand.
Currently, Top Glove management is targeting to increase capacity to 86.4bn pieces by the end of December 2020 and to 100.4bn pieces by the end of December 2021 (compared to 81.6bn pieces and 91.1bn pieces respectively). The revised expansion is 6% and 10% higher compared to the Group’s initial CY20 and CY21 targets, if it comes on stream as planned.
4QFY20 glove demand to come from US and Latin America.
The COVID-19 outbreak has led to increased demand for gloves. At the initial stage of the coronavirus outbreak in February-March 2020, the increased sales orders came from China, Hong Kong, Singapore and Korea. Top Glove also received strong sales orders from other regions such as Europe (Germany, Spain and Italy) in 3QFY20.
We understand that US and Latin America orders increased in 4QFY20. Latex and nitrile gloves’ order book lead time has increased up to 420 days in June 2020 compared to 300 days in April 2020 and 30-40 days prior to the virus outbreak.
Raw material prices are likely to increase by about 10% in 4QFY20. However, the higher ASP should be sufficient to offset the increase in raw material prices.
Stronger balance sheet.
Top Glove was in a net cash position as of end-May 2020 (of RM279m) on the back of significant improvement in operating cash flow from the strong profit performance, better working capital management (working capital days was reduced to 32 in 3QFY20 vs 47 in 2QFY20) and conversion of convertible bonds into shares.
Reiterate BUY With Target Price of RM18.45
We maintain our Target Price at RM18.45, based on PE of 39x CY21F earnings. This is based on +2 SD of its 5-year mean.
Top Glove is trading at 35x CY21F PE or close to +1.6 SD of its 5-year mean PE. Maintain BUY in view of its strong earnings outlook.
Potential Catalysts
Stronger-than-expected ASP and sales volume will further drive the company’s earnings and Top Glove share price. Every 1% improvement in net margin could boost Top Glove’s net profit by 7.4%. A second wave of COVID-19 infections after the gradual easing of lockdowns could see glove demand sustained at high levels.
In the long term, even as infection rates ease, we expect COVID-19 to drive increased usage of gloves globally, sustaining a “new normal” of demand.

  Still screaming buy for Top Glove as it prepares for more bumper results
  KUALA LUMPUR (June 12): Being one of the world’s best performing benchmark index component stocks thus far and even after more than tripling its share price since the beginning of this year, Top Glove Corp Bhd remains as the favourite among research firms.
Poised for a record-breaking financial year ending Aug 31, 2020 (FY20), after the quantum leap in earnings seen in Top Glove’s third quarter ended May 31, 2020 (3QFY20), three-quarters of the analysts covering the counter are screaming “buy” calls.
According to Bloomberg, out of the 20 analysts covering the stock, half of them have target prices of RM20 and above, with the highest at RM25 from CGS-CIMB Research and Kenanga Research. This would also imply a 49% headroom from the current share price.
While global markets are experiencing a second wave of global rout after the dovish comment from the US Federal Reserve, shares of Top Glove remain steady and were up 12 sen or 0.72% at RM16.82 at noon break.
“We continue to like Top Glove as the key beneficiary of the current favourable supply-demand dynamic in the glove sector due to the Covid-19 outbreak, given that it is the world’s largest glove maker by capacity (78.7 billion pieces per annum currently),” said CGS-CIMB Research Walter Aw, in a note yesterday.
Going forward, he expects Top Glove to continue recording sequentially stronger results on a quarterly basis in FY21 on the back of higher glove sales, further increase in average selling prices (ASPs), and better economies of scale.
With the strong global demand for gloves, Top Glove has also been gradually increasing its production capacity and it expects to reach 100.4 billion pieces by the end of FY21.
Furthermore, Top Glove also plans to raise the ASPs by 15% a month in July and August respectively, which would widen its profit margin.
The rubber glove maker’s profit margin swelled to 21% in 3QFY20 versus 6% in the preceding year corresponding quarter.
Some staying cautious, despite being confident of stronger results to come
Still, as Top Glove's share price has tripled in the last five-and-a-half months, a couple of analysts are turning cautious, despite the stronger earnings outlook, and have downgraded their calls for Top Glove to “hold” as they believe that the positive has already been priced in.
Out of the 20 analysts covering the stock, five have “neutral” ratings on the rubber glove maker.
PublicInvest Research analyst Chua Siu Li, for one, has downgraded the call on Top Glove to “neutral” from “outperform”, with a higher target price of RM19.30 from RM12.70 previously.
“While we do not discount the fact that Top Glove is capable of delivering record-breaking profits, we believe the exceptionally strong results are not sustainable in the long run, hence we deem it is unjustified to continue valuing Top Glove at 43 times price-to-earnings (PE) (+2SD of its five-year historical mean),” said Chua, in a note today.
In that regard, Chua is cutting PE multiple on Top Glove to 31 times (+1SD of its five-year historical mean).
Valuation-wise, Top Glove's trailing 12-month PE stood at 71.88 times — the highest among its peers, according to Bloomberg. It is also very expensive when compared to its five-year average PE of 23.87 times.
Additionally, Chua also highlighted the possible risk of the government imposing windfall tax as the glove industry is one of the very few sectors that benefited significantly from the pandemic outbreak. Previously, the government had imposed a windfall tax on the plantation sector.
Nonetheless, she reckoned that the chances of this happening to the glove sector is low as gloves are predominantly for the export markets and unlike the plantation sector, there is no urgent need to stabilise glove prices in the domestic market.
However, Chua is also adopting a more cautious stance on Top Glove currently, as its share price has rallied circa 180% since an upgrade in end-January. She is of the view that the risk-reward ratio has turned less favourable for investors currently.
HSBC’s Shuo Han Tan, on the other hand, has maintained a “hold” rating with a target price of RM15 — the lowest among the research firms."

Top Glove reported a net profit of RM347.9m in 3QFY20, up 200% QoQ and 367% YoY. Quarterly revenue stood at RM1688.3m, +37.3% QoQ and +41.8% YoY. Additionally, the Group handed out an operating profit of RM429.9m which equated to 188% YoY growth.
Robust 9MFY20 result. The Group reported a revenue of RM4147.7m in 9MFY20 which increased 14.8% YoY. Besides, the Group recorded a stellar operating profit of RM728.5m (+78% YoY). As a result, net profit came at RM580m (+100% YoY).
Above our expectation but below consensus. 9MFY20 net profit accounts for 102%/63.4% of our/consensus full year estimates. However, the reported revenue matches 73.4% of our full year forecast.
Divided declared. Top Glove has declared a first interim dividend of 10 sen/share. We raise our dividend forecast for FY2020F to 18 sen.
Comments
Impressive YoY performance. Top Glove’s revenue up 41.8% YoY due to higher average selling price of gloves (+9% YoY) as well as higher sales volume across all products (+24% YoY). The Group’s operating profit increased 188% YoY because of lower nitrile latex raw material price (-14% YoY), mild drop of natural rubber (-4% YoY). Also, the Group recorded substantially higher YoY profit before tax for its 9MFY20 at RM682.6m (+106.4%) because of lower finance cost (-27.3% YoY) pertaining to higher conversion of bond to shares.
Vigorous QoQ result. The Group recorded gains of revenue (+37.3% QoQ), operating profit (+188% QoQ), and profit after tax (+202% QoQ). These were boosted by strong sales volume growth from nitrile gloves (+27% QoQ) and natural rubber gloves (+25% QoQ), and 14% surge in surgical gloves. Also, breakeven of Vinyl gloves segment with sales volume growth of 17% QoQ. As a result, PBT and PAT elevated to RM422m and RM350m respectively (+224% QoQ/+202% QoQ) respectively. Likewise, lower raw material costs, rising economies of scale, and higher ASPs resulted in operating profit margin expanded by 13.3 ppts QoQ.
Longer lead time. The lead time for all products escalated to average 300 days from pre COVID-19, 30 – 40 days. Orders from all around the world have taken place as a precautious move of preventing worsening of the pandemic. Germany, Taiwan, and Spain sales order inflated 572%, 416%, and 469% MoM respectively.
Concrete evidence on higher ASPs. National cost of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) in the US has gone up 45% (Figure 3) since March 2020 where the outbreak of COVID-19 intensified in the US. The US has the highest number of COVID-10 cases triggered the demand on gloves in the hospitals as to handle a large number of patients. Meanwhile, the country’s citizens have started to stay cautious to deal with COVID-19 by consuming more gloves and wearing masks. Moving forward, we believe the trend is set to prolong after easing of COVID-19 cases globally.
Potential resurgence of COVID-19 infection rate in the US. “Rt Covid-19” is a key measure of how fast the virus is spreading. Currently, the values of “Rt” in 16 states (Figure 4) are above 1.0 while the number of states with “Rt” above 1.0 in 6 weeks ago (Figure 5) were just 7. We are seeing the “Rt” value is increasing in more states in the US as sign of virus to spread quickly. The spread of COVID-19 is accelerating mainly due to the US ongoing protest which started last week, as a result of the people did not practice social distancing.
Risks include:
Limitation on further hike in ASPs. The New York’ s Governor Cuomo has signed a legislation banning price gouging of Personal Protective Equipment on 8 June 2020. The move could pressure glove manufacturer to lower the selling prices of gloves. In addition, we think other governors in the United States will follow the policy soon to halt on the rising PPE prices. The move is likely to mirror by vicinal countries such as Canada, Mexico, and South America.
Downtrend of USD. USD has weakened against MYR since March 2020, weakening 4.67% which is in line with the decline of DXY (Dollar Index Spot) of 6.64% in the same period. Weakening of USD and rising of raw material prices upon easing of global lockdown will squeeze the Group’s profit margin as it loses out the advantage as an exporter.
Earnings Outlook/Revision
We revise upward our FY20F and FY21F net earnings forecasts by +74% and +321% to RM992.5m and RM2,247.9m respectively. We also introduce our FY22F net profit of RM904.8m on the expectation of higher ASPs (+15%) and low raw material prices. Overall, we envisage Top Glove’s net earnings for FY20F and FY21F to grow strongly at +170.1% yoy and +126.5% yoy respectively before normalise, -59.7% yoy in FY22F.
Valuation & Recommendation
Upgrade to BUY with a higher target price of RM22.41 (previous target price of RM7.60) after our earnings upgrade. Our revised target price is now pegged at 33x CY21F PER, which is at +0.5 SD above its 5-year historical mean PE on the back of brighter outlook in respect of resilient glove demand. We peg our valuation to CY21 instead of FY21 considering the impact of earnings normalisation in FY22F after exceptional strong profit growth in FY21F pursuant to the pandemic.

  https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/12/share-price-of-malaysias-top-glove-surged-due-to-coronavirus-pandemic.html


    The share price of Malaysia’s Top Glove, the world’s largest medical glove maker, has more than tripled this year thanks to the coronavirus pandemic — and analysts said the stock could still climb higher.
The company’s shares listed on the Malaysian stock exchange have surged by more than 255% this year as of Thursday, according to Refinitiv data. Its Singapore-listed shares experienced a similar jump of over 256%, the data showed.
A surge in demand for gloves “from virtually every country in the world” as a result of the coronavirus pandemic pushed Top Glove’s quarterly earnings to a record high, the company announced on Thursday. The coronavirus disease or Covid-19, which first emerged in China late last year, has since spread to at least 188 countries and territories globally.
Many analysts are bullish on the stock. Based on data compiled by Refinitiv, 18 out of 22 analysts have a “strong buy” or “buy” recommendation on Top Glove. The analysts have a median target price of 20.28 Malaysian ringgit ($4.75) for the stock — higher than Thursday’s close of 16.70 ringgit ($3.91) per share.
Ng Chi Hoong, an analyst at Malaysian investment bank Affin Hwang, raised his target price for Top Glove to 22.40 ringgit ($5.24) per share “to factor in the stronger demand outlook” while maintaining his “buy” recommendation.
“We believe that concerns that demand could fall dramatically as new COVID-19 infection cases start to fall is overly hyped, as demand from China has continued to grow despite having successfully controlled the spread of the virus,” Ng wrote in a Thursday note.
‘Extraordinary’ financial performance
Its net profit in the quarter ended May leaped 366% year over year to 347.9 million Malaysian ringgit ($81.4 million) — almost equal to the previous full-year profit of 367.5 million ringgit ($86.0 million). That came on the back of a record quarterly revenue of 1.69 billion ringgit ($395.5 million) – a gain of 413% compared to a year ago.
“The Group’s extraordinary performance was attributed to unparalleled growth in Sales Volume, on the back of the global COVID-19 pandemic,” Top Glove said in its latest financial statement.
“Monthly sales orders went up by some 180%,” it added.
But “the best is yet to come” and the company could break its quarterly record, Executive Director Lim Cheong Guan said in an online briefing, as reported by Reuters. That’s because many customers have made orders way in advance — for delivery more than a year later — “for fear of losing out,” according to the report.
Such an increase in demand has led to an increase in the average selling price of Top Glove’s products by as much as 30% since the start of this year. The company said it has added production capacity to meet that demand."

KUALA LUMPUR (June 12): The craze for glove stocks has cooled down as the second wave of equity rout sweeps across the globe. All glove counters listed on Bursa Malaysia are down, except for Top Glove Corp Bhd, which managed to claw back to the positive territory after it started on a soft note.
As at 10am, Top Glove was up 14 sen or 0.84% at RM16.84 with 9.65 million shares traded.
All its peers in the glove sector are in the red, led by Comfort Gloves Bhd, which was down 2.03% or six sen at RM2.89, followed by Supermax Corp Bhd that declined 1.82% or 15 sen to RM8.10 and Kossan Rubber Industries Bhd, which slipped 1.43% or 13 sen to RM8.97.
Hartalega Holdings Bhd was 1.29% or 16 sen lower at RM12.28, while Careplus Group Bhd was down 0.68% or one sen at RM1.47.
After the strong rally that lifted the glove makers' share prices several folds, dealers said investors are likely to take some profit off the table. Meanwhile, the glove bulls are commenting that this could be an entry opportunity for those who missed the early boat given the mounting concerns over the second wave of infections in the US.
Yesterday, Top Glove announced its best-ever quarterly net profit at RM347.9 million for the third quarter ended May 31, 2020 (3QFY20), which more than quadrupled from RM74.67 million last year, while quarterly revenue was up 41.85% to RM1.69 billion — also the strongest-ever quarterly top line, from RM1.19 billion in 3QFY19.
This quarter's net profit already makes up 94% of the net profit for the full financial year ended Aug 30, 2019 (FY19) of RM370.56 million.
The rubber glove maker attributed its stellar performance to the ""unparalleled growth in sales volume, on the back of the global Covid-19 pandemic"".
Top Glove told the media that it has yet to see the peak of its exponential earnings growth, which will be fuelled by soaring demand for rubber gloves and higher average selling prices.
""While this may be our most outstanding results to date, prepare to watch us break our own record in the upcoming quarters, because our best days are still ahead,"" Top Glove executive director Lim Cheong Guan said in a virtual press conference via Zoom.
The world's largest glove maker has also declared an interim dividend of 10 sen per share in respect of FY20, payable on July 9.

Earnings above our expectation
Strong earnings in 9MFY20 on higher sales of gloves and lower raw material prices
Poised for record year
Earnings estimate revised upwards
Downgrade to Neutral from Buy with a revised TP of RM17.30
Earnings above our expectation. Top Glove’s 9MFY20 core net profit of RM596.3m came in within consensus’ but beat our expectation, meeting 114% of our full year forecast. The positive deviation could be attributed to the stronger-than-expected sales of gloves and the lowerthan-expected raw material prices. Meanwhile, Top Glove declared an interim dividend of 10 sen per share.
Strong earnings in 9MFY20. On sequential basis, 3QFY20 earnings surged to RM365m (+195%qoq) mainly attributed to higher sales of gloves and lower raw material prices. Sales quantity of nitrile gloves and natural rubber gloves increased by 27%qoq and 25%qoq respectively as Covid-19 pandemic has led to strong demand for gloves. Besides, higher ASP and lower raw material prices had also boosted earnings in 3QFY20. Meanwhile, 9MFY20 core net profit was higher at RM596.3m (+99%yoy), boosted by higher ASP of gloves, higher sales quantity and lower raw material prices. That has led to PBT margin expansion in 9MFY20 to 16.4% from 9.7% in 9MFY19.
Poised for record year. Earnings outlook for Top Glove remains positive as we gather that ASP of gloves will be higher in 4Q20 as demand for gloves remains strong. Note that Top Glove revises its ASP on monthly basis in line with prevailing market prices and rakes it higher percentage of spot sales with higher spot market price. Besides, new gloves production capacity of Top Glove is expected to grow by 36% from 73.8bil pcs in 3QFY20 to 100.4bil pcs in 4QFY21. Hence, we revise our FY20/21/22F earnings by +97.3%/+74.2%/+54.1% and expect Top Glove to post record profit in FY20.
Downgrade to Neutral from Buy with a revised TP of RM17.30. Corresponding to the upward revisions in earnings, our TP for Top Glove is revised to RM17.31 (previously RM6.63), pegging 45x PER at FY21 EPS of 38.5sen. We value Top Glove at its upcycle PER of +2SD 3-year historical mean PER in view of the positive outlook for gloves demand. While we like Top Glove for its positive earnings outlook and solid balance sheet of net cash position, we think that the positives have been largely priced in. Hence, we are downgrading our call on Top Glove to Neutral from Buy.

topglove,"Fri, 12 Jun 2020, 9:23 AM",Top Glove Corporation Berhad- Stretched Valuations - PublicInvest Research | I3investor,https://klse.i3investor.com/blogs/PublicInvest/2020-06-12-story-h1508755324-Top_Glove_Corporation_Berhad_Stretched_Valuations.jsp,"Top Glove reported a net profit of RM575m (+97.9% YoY) for 9MFY20, which was within our but missed consensus forecast at 72% and 63% respectively. The strong results delivered was due to margin expansion, given that the global glove supply shortage had driven ASPs higher. We believe Top Glove will continue to deliver supernormal earnings in the subsequent quarters, considering the continuous ASP hike and additional capacity coming in to cater for ad-hoc orders that are usually priced at a premium compared to the ordinary recurring orders. For that, we raise our earnings forecast for FY20-21F by 35-160%, to account for the positives mentioned. Subsequently, we raise our TP to RM19.30 (from RM12.70 previously). However, our valuation is now pegged to a lower PE multiple of 31x (at +1SD of its 5-year historical mean), as we are of the view that it not justifiable to value Top Glove at a PE multiple of 43x (+2SD of its 5-year historical mean), given that the supernormal profits for the coming quarters are not sustainable in nature. We downgrade our call on Top Glove from Outperform to Neutral. On a side note, Top Glove also declared a dividend of 10sen per share.
Outstanding quarter. Top Glove’s revenue grew strongly by 42% YoY in 3QFY20, on the back of stronger sales volume (+24% YoY) as well as ASP improvement (+9% YoY). The stronger sales volume was supported by the spike in rubber gloves demand following the global outbreak of Covid-19. Sudden increase in demand has also led to the group registering higher ASP. In tandem with the in stronger profit, EBITDA also leaped by 134% YoY to RM477m, given that stronger USD (+5% YoY) and lower raw material costs (latex price: -4% YoY; nitrile price: -14% YoY) all work in Top Glove’s favor. With utilization rate peaking at 95% during the quarter, better economies of scale also contributed to margins expansion. Top Glove’s EBITDA margin improved by 11 ppts YoY to 28%.
Pennies from heaven. We believe Top Glove will continue to record supernormal profits, given that its order lead time for latex and nitrile gloves has reached c.400 days currently and the ASP for its gloves are also expected to continue rising strongly considering the global shortage. While we expect raw material prices to start trending higher going forward, we reckon that the quantum of ASP increase should be sufficient to account for the rising raw material cost. On a separate note, Top Glove has also guided that all new capacities coming on stream will be allocated to cater for ad-hoc orders, which are generally priced at a 100-150% premium as compared to the usual recurring orders. With that being said, we raise our earnings forecasts for Top Glove for FY20-21F by 35-160% to account for the positives that should help support Top Glove’s strong earnings growth in the coming quarters.
Still good but turning cautious. While we do not discount the fact that Top Glove is capable of delivering record-breaking profits, we believe the exceptionally strong results are not sustainable in the long run, hence we deem it is unjustified to continue valuing Top Glove at 43x PE (+2SD of its 5-year historical mean). In that regard, we are cutting our PE multiple on Top Glove to 31x (+1SD of its 5-year historical mean). We also highlight the possible risk of government imposing windfall tax as the glove industry is one of the very few sectors that benefitted significantly from the pandemic outbreak. Previously, the government had imposed windfall tax on the plantation sector. Having said that, we reckon that the chances of this happening to the glove sector is low as gloves are predominantly for the export markets and unlike the plantation sector, there is no urgent need to stabilize glove prices in the domestic market. Nevertheless, we are also adopting a more cautious stance on Top Glove currently, as its share price has rallied c.180% since our upgrade in end-January and we are of view that the risk reward ratio has turned less favorable for investors currently.

The result is deemed above our expectation. The variance from our forecast is due to higher-than-expected margins. Hence, we raised our FY20E/FY21E net profit by 22%/30%, to account for higher margins. TP is raised from RM20.10 to RM25.00 based on unchanged 36x CY21E revised EPS. Reiterate Outperform.
QoQ, 3QFY20 revenue rose 37% due to higher sales volume (+25%) and ASP (+5%). Correspondingly, PBT margin improved by a massive 14.4ppt to 25% compared to 10.6% in 2QFY20 due to higher ASP which theoretically flow straight down to bottom-line as well as gains from greater efficiency and economies of scale. This brings 3QFY20 PATAMI to RM348m (+200%). A 1st interim DPS of 10.0 sen was announced which came in above our expectation.
YoY, 9MFY20 revenue rose 14% due to higher volume sales (+45%) and ASP (+3%). Utilisation shot up from 85% to >95%. Interestingly, Aspion’s capacity was also instrumental in enabling Top Glove to meet the intensified demand driven by revenue (+48%) bringing 9MFY20 net profit which grew four-fold to RM47m, as the Group’s concentrated efforts to improve efficiency, quality and profitability bore fruit. This propelled 9MFY20 PATAMI higher by 98% to RM575m.
Monthly sales remained tight, net cash position restored. Monthly sales orders went up by some 180%, resulting in long lead times, which went up from 40 days to around 400 days, with orders placed now to be delivered only over a year later. As at 31 May 2020, the group entered into a net cash position of RM279m compared with net borrowings in 2QFY20 which enabled the Group to internally fund capex requirements. We highlight that TOPGLOV’s ASP for months of June to Aug is higher by 15% m-o-m further indicating supply tightness that have further propelled ASP higher. In the 3QFY20 results teleconference, management highlighted that 20% of new capacity will be allocated to spot price which is between USD80 to USD100/1,000 pieces. With a diverse customer base, we expect TOPLGOV to have better pricing power and hence potentially higher-than-expected industry average prices.
Capacity expansion include: Factory 7A (operational by end-1Q 2020; 0.4bn pieces), Factory 2B (operational by 1Q 2020; 0.7b pieces), Factory 5A (operational by 1Q 2020; 2.5b pieces), Factory 40 (Phase 1 operational by 2Q 2020 and Phase 2 operational by 3Q 2020; 2.7b and 2.0b pieces), Factory F41 (2Q 2020; 4b pieces) and Factory 8A (by 4Q 2020; 3.5b pieces) to boost the group’s production capacity in 2020 by 11.8b gloves per annum to 81.9b (+17%).
Raised FY20E/FY21E net profit by 22%/30% after raising our FY20/FY21 EBITDA margin assumption from 23%/26%% to 27%/32%.
Reiterate OP. Correspondingly, TP is raised from RM20.10 RM25.00 based on unchanged 36x CY21E revised EPS of 69.20 sen (at slightly above +2.0SD above 5-year historical forward mean). Its merits are: (i) strong management, (ii) the booming gloves market due to the pandemic, and (iii) solid earnings growth averaging 130% per annum compared to FY20E and FY21E PERs of 37x and 24x, respectively.
A key downside risk to our call is lower-than-expected ASP.

Dividend. Declared first interim dividend of 10 sen per share going ex on the 25 Jun 2020 (3QFY19: 3.5 sen per share).
QoQ. Revenue of RM1.7bn was the highest attained, with an increase of +37.3% thanks to stronger sales volume (+25%) and improved ASPs (+5%). The improvement was mainly due to Covid-19 which lifted all glove segments: Nitrile gloves (volume: +27%, ASP: +4%), Natural Rubber gloves (volume: +25%, ASP: +8%), Surgical glove (volume: +14%, ASP: +5%) and Vinyl glove (volume: +17%, ASP: +12%). EBITDA margin improved by 12.4 ppts to 28.2% due to the increased production utilisation at c.97% (2QFY20: 86%) and also lower NBR prices (-10%) while NR prices remained flattish (-1%). The strengthening of USD (+5%) also aided the boost. Subsequently, core PATMI improved to RM365m (+195%).
YoY. Revenue improved (+41.8%) due to the increase in sales volume (+24%) and improved ASPs (+9%). This was contributed by: Nitrile gloves (volume: +47%, ASP: +5%), Natural Rubber gloves (volume: +8%, ASP: +10%), Surgical glove (volume: +21%, ASP: +6%) This was slightly offset by the decrease of sales volume for Vinyl glove segment (-15%), but saw improvement of ASPs (+31%). EBITDA margin increased by 16.5 ppts (from 11.7%) on the back of greater efficiency from higher utilization (c.97% vs. 3QFY19: 80%) as well as lower raw materials prices; lower NBR prices (-14%) and lower NR prices (-4%). The strengthening of USD (+5%) also helped the boost. All in, core PATMI rose (+>350%) to RM365m.
YTD. Revenue increased to RM4.1bn (+14.3%) attributed to higher volumes (+8.6%) and ASPs (+3%). EBITDA grew by +65.4%; with margin increased to 20.8% (from 14.3%), on the back of greater operational efficiencies. Core PATMI improved by +99% to RM596.3m, due to the abovementioned factors (stronger sales volume and ASPs as well as lower raw material prices and tax; 15% vs 9MFY19: 16%).
Outlook. We expect stronger a 4QFY20 and FY21 driven by improved demand, stronger ASPs and more spot orders (we understand in 3QFY20 spot orders were minimal as it was only the beginning and to date, it makes up about c.20% of capacity). Lead time pre-Covid-19 of 30-40 days has significantly soared to the current average of 292 days. Fuelled with running at full capacity and currently producing 78.7bn gloves p.a., with expected production of 100.4bn pieces p.a. by 2021; we feel Top Glove is at a supportable situation to cater to the increasing demand

We maintain BUY on Top Glove with a higher fair value of RM20.06/share (vs. RM17.38 previously). Our valuation is based on a PE of 33x CY21F EPS. We raise our earnings forecast by 1.3% for FY20F, 13.6% for FY21F and 22.6% for FY22F. This is to reflect the updated expansion plans where capacity expansion is bigger by 3% in CY20, +10.3% in CY21 and +10.9% in CY22, compared to previous plans presented on 18 May 2020 (as shown in Exhibit 2).
Top Glove’s 9MFY20 net profit of RM575mil (+98% YoY) accounted for 45% of our and 63% of consensus’ full-year earnings estimates. We believe 4QFY20F will prove to be an even better quarter for the group due to a full-blown impact of Covid-19 pandemic with significantly higher selling prices and sales volume. Hence, we think that the results are in line with our expectations but above consensus.
Top Glove’s 3QFY20 revenue grew 37% QoQ (+42% YoY). This was on the back of higher sales volume and ASP, underpinned by Covid-19 pandemic (breakdown shown in Exhibit 3).
Sales volume was higher by 25% QoQ (24% YoY) as utilisation rate soared to more than 95% from 85%. Sales volume in developed markets expanded 14% QoQ while in developing markets, it jumped by 34.5% QoQ. The strongest growth came from Asia ex Japan at 62.7% while the lowest growth was from North America at 4.6%.
ASP rose 5% QoQ (+9% YoY) to roughly US$22–US$27 per 1,000 pieces. The group’s top line was further lifted by a 5% QoQ and YoY weakening of the MYR against the USD.
The improved operational metrics resulted in a PBT of RM422mil in 3QFY20 with a 14ppt QoQ increase in PBT margin to 25% (+18ppt YoY). Top Glove also enjoyed lower raw material prices. Latex raw material price was lower by 1% QoQ (-4% YoY) while nitrile raw material price dropped by 10% QoQ (-14% YoY).
Demand remains strong with a much longer lead time of around 400 days compared with the usual 40 days. Monthly sales orders shot up around 180%.
9MFY20 revenue grew 14% YoY to RM4,127mil as sales volume grew 9% while ASP edged up 3%. The USD strengthened by 2% YoY against the MYR in 9MFY20. Nitrile sales mix was also higher at 47% (42% in FY19)
In the past 1 month, sales orders from various countries surged. Compared with Jan 2020, sales orders from China leapt 310%, Japan +84%, South Korea +159%, Taiwan +416%, USA +147% and Germany +572%.

    PART 1 : Read Here
  Date : 12 June 2020
      PART 2 : GLOVES SECTOR - THIS IS MY REAL PLAN ON PHASE II FY20 - FY21
    So today as we all know and expected Top Glove Bhd released its excellent and superb quaterly financial result. With strong worldwide demand for rubber gloves amid the COVID-19 pandemic, it is unsurprising that Top Glove Corp Bhd has recorded its best-ever quarterly net profit in the third quarter ended May 31, 2020 (3QFY20)
  Top Glove executive director Lim Cheong Guan said strong orders and demand are expected to continue for the next one to two years. In 3QFY20, sales of nitrile gloves jumped 47% year-on-year (y-o-y), natural rubber gloves sales leaped 8%, and surgical gloves sales rose 21%.
  From here perspective, we already know how good their business is. So as I told many times Gloves Sector already applied in ""Defending Stocks Territory"". Also I am agreed some analysts said Top Glove have projected a net profit of as high as RM3 billion for FY21 So if they really can archieved that of course and definitely my last target RM35 surely hit FY21.
      WHAT KIM SAID ABOUT GLOVES SECTOR NOW?
      1. ""BUY IN JUNE HISTORY WILL REPEAT PREVIOUS APRIL""
    - Today we had received very clear signal. We can buyback / Addmore cheap gloves. Follow the waves you will be safe in the ocean.
  - Today also I saw many new retailers those bought high cutloss because not have holding power.
  - Gloves, for sure now you cant do daytrade. It not easier like before or previous 6 months.
  - Tomorrow I am expect Gloves stock only good performance and will lead the market movement.
  - After 6 month gloves performing, now another 6 months to go. As I am expecting Gloves will play role till March 2021. So I am not worried holding as investement till next year.
  - My planned as follows : 
  1 month (Buy) next 5 month (Sell)  - January - June FY20
  1 month (Buy) next 5 month (Sell) - June - Dec FY20
  1 month (Buy) next 3 month (Sell) - Jan - Apr FY21
  - I am expecting the profits of quaterly and yearly results. Not base on when this Covid-19 will be end and vaccine will be found. So Big-4 gloves profits already calculating on paper profits FY21.
      2. ""COVID-19 PHASE II JUST STARTED
    - COVID-19 heading to 10,000,000 within another 3 months

- COVID-19 heading to 5,000,000 within another 3 months
  - Globally, there have been 7,273,958 confirmed cases, including 413,372 deaths has been reported to WHO.
  - Case Comparison (Confirmed Cases) as below :

Americas - 3,485,245
Europe - 2,339,145
Eastern Mediterranean - 696,841
South-East Asia - 407,414
Western Pacific - 194,470
Africa - 150,102
      3. ""OTHERS GLOVES STOCK - LIMITED""
    - After 6 month end-up. Others gloves stock like Comfort, Ruberex, Carepls, Esceram etc etc. Must monitor closely and cautiously. Why?
  - Because, in my views all of them already hit on limited ceiling. So I dont think it will go more beyond and so far from here. It will have big corrections and adjusting their P/E and their capacity etc Phase II COVID-19 the countries and frontliners already well prepared.

- So my advise is. Only focus Big-4 counter
  1. Top Glove
2. Harta
3. Kossan
4. Supermx
  - More worst if others are limited / small production on their exports to other market (International)
  - But Big-4 have no problem with their exports/produce capacity, etc.
    4. ""CRUDE & BRENT OIL BREAK DOWN LOWER""
    - Brent & Crude already slump down 8-10% today.
  - History will repeat previous 2 months ago. 
  - Signal very clear phase II just started.
  - Frankly in my view, I still no confidence in Oils performance yet. There still no good news or cover news from OPEC. Even Trump and Putin still play Joker Card.
      5. ""DOW JONES INDEX""
    - I am predicting Dow Jones will slump and break down badly again amid Phase II Covid-19 hit badly America Latin. Second wave fears spark global share sell-off. Index will be around 20,000 - 22,000 from current now stand at 25,700
  - More manipulation / speech from Mr. T will make their more worst because to satisfy their-self agenda. 
  - Incidence of violence and inhumanity against blacks in their country already facing very big issue.
  - The number of U.S. coronavirus infections passed the two million mark and over 112,000 Americans have died.
-

TOPGLOVE Q3 FY 2020
相信最近有手套股的业绩出来， 多数是手套股还是不是手套股的投资者都好， 都会去看看最新季度的业绩， 看看暴涨到什么程度， 小编今天也去抽热闹看看TopGlove的季报啦， 也帮各位读者做个总结， 不用看18页的报告~话不多说， 进入篇章：
财政报表
 Q3 FY2020 的营业额增加了42% 左右 或者 RM 498.09 mil， 从 RM 1.19 bil 增加至 RM 1.69 bil。
税前盈利则暴升413% 或者 RM 339.78 mil， 从 RM 82.24 mil暴涨至 RM 422.02 mil。
营业额和税前盈利的增加主要是公司的销售量因为Covid-19而对手套的需求而增加。
 TopGlove的营业额来自不同国家， 主要有马来西亚、 泰国、 中国和其他国家， 但是马来西亚的营业额占了大部分， 大约占了总营业额的85.8%、 泰国占了7.3% 左右、 中国占了1.4%和其他国家占了5.5%。
总资产方面对比FY 2019增加了30% 左右或者 RM 1.71 bil， 主要是PPE、 trade and other receivables、 investment securities 和 cash and bank balances的增加所导致。
短期Investment securities 增加了RM 1.36 bil， 而cash and bank balances 则增加了 RM 182 mil， 主要原因是第一批的回教债卷的发行完成所收到的钱， 除了用来偿还贷款， 其他的放在investment securities， 而在现金流表也贡献了融资现金流的净现金流入。
 总债务方面则减少了14%左右或者 RM 424.05 mil， 从RM 3.13 bil减少至 RM 2.71 bil。
长期贷款和短期贷款都减少了， 各别减少RM 420.03 mil和 RM 485.31 mil， 主要是回教债卷的发行所筹集到的资金一部分来偿还贷款。
 从YTD FY 2020 的现金流表可以看到营运活动净现金流如高达RM 1.2 bil， 主要是税前盈利的的增加、 贸易与其他应付账款和合同责任的增加所导致。
YTD FY 2020的投资活动处于高达RM 1.67 bil的净现金流出， 主要是placement of investment securities 和 购买PPE。
融资活动方面则拥有高达 RM 652.2 mil 的净现金流入， 归功于回教债卷的发行筹集得 RM 1.3 bil的资金。
由于YTD FY 2020的税前盈利大幅度增加和发行回教债卷， 所以TopGlove在YTD FY 2020是出于较高的净现金流入， cash and cash equivalents也增加了 RM 182.04 mil。
Prospects 前景
             公司管理层表示会继续实行扩展来满足市场对医用手套和非医用手套的需求， 截至目前为止， 公司预留RM 3 bil来建造450新的生产线的资本支出， 为了达到每年生产600亿片的手套。 各位可以参考下图表截至CY 2020的发展进度：
            除此之外， 位于Banting的工厂 – 在 Factory 42 的 Top Glove Innovation Complex (TGIC) 是新的制造和研究中心。 这家制造厂利用工业4.0科技、 大数据分析来增加生产的效率， 同时针对重复性的工作减少对员工的依赖， 而这家工厂预计会在 CY 2020的第二季度完成第一阶段。
            管理层强调接下来的季度有很高的需求量， 接下来的季度会很强劲， 同时也会专注在创新、 科技、 品质和成本效率。
 技术图
TopGlove的股价可以看到在5月头的时候就开始暴涨，一路可以说90度地疯狂上涨， 主要源自于全世界对手套的需求量增加。 从5月12日的暴涨截至最高价， 暴涨幅度高达140% 左右。 至于RSI指标来看， 股价暴涨的过程一直处于超买的区域， 很多投资者都涌入购买手套股， 导致股价飙升得很厉害。

topglove,"Thu, 11 Jun 2020, 10:27 PM",Top Glove - The Best Is Yet to Come - KL Trader Investment Research Articles | I3investor,https://klse.i3investor.com/blogs/kltrader/2020-06-11-story-h1508760035-Top_Glove_The_Best_Is_Yet_to_Come.jsp,"Top Glove's 9MFY8/20 net profit of RM575m (+97.9% y-o-y) was in line with our forecast, but above Bloomberg consensus’ estimates.
We expect Top Glove to record sequentially-stronger quarters ahead, in tandem with capacity increases and more ASP hikes.
Maintain ADD with an unchanged Target Price of RM25.00 (22x CY21 P/E).
Top Glove's 9MFY8/20 Net Profit Rose 97.9% Y-o-y; Within Our Expectations
Top Glove’s 3QFY8/20 net profit came in at RM347.9m (+366% y-o-y), bringing 9MFY8/20 net profit to RM575m (+97.9% y-o-y). We deem this as within our expectations (42% of our full-year forecast), but above Bloomberg consensus’ estimates (63% of theirs). This is given our expectations of stronger q-o-q and y-o-y results in 4QFY20.
Top Glove also announced an interim dividend of 10sen/share, within our expectations.
Top Glove's 3QFY8/20: Boosted by ASP Hikes and Sales Due to Covid-19
Top Glove's 3QFY8/20 revenue rose 37.3% q-o-q, thanks to increases in both sales volume (+25% q-o-q) and average selling prices (ASPs) (+5% q-o-q). Besides benefiting from the higher revenue, 3QFY20 EBITDA margins expanded to 28.4% (+11.8% pts q-o-q), thanks to:
better economies of scale (utilisation rate rose 10% pts q-o-q to 95%),
lower raw material prices (nitrile butadiene: -10% q-o-q & natural rubber: -1% q-o-q), and
stronger US$ vs. ringgit (+5% q-o-q).
Accordingly, 3QFY20 net profit rose 201% q-o-q to RM348m, despite higher tax (+6% pts q-o-q) and increase in depreciation charges (+5.3% q-o-q).
Order Book Visibility Continues to Rise Beyond 1HCY21
Top Glove expects demand for gloves to be strong until at least 3QFY8/22. This is given that its order lead time as at Jun 20 has risen by 13-14 months to Jul-Aug 21 (from 10 months at Apr 20). In addition, it is also seeing an increase in spot orders, with the company planning to allocate 20% of its capacity catering to spot orders (our current estimates input only 10% spot orders) that enjoy higher selling prices (2-3x of recurring orders).
Expect Sequentially-stronger Results Up to FY21
Going forward, we expect Top Glove to continue recording sequentially-stronger results on a quarterly basis in FY21. This is premised on:
higher glove sales,
further increase in ASPs, and
better economies of scale.
We gather that Top Glove plans to gradually raise its ASPs (+30% q-o-q in 4QFY20 followed by +15.7% q-o-q in 1QFY22) with the gradual commissioning of new production capacity of 26.6bn by end-4QFY21 (36% growth from capacity of 73.8bn pieces p.a. at end-3QFY20).
Maintain ADD, With Unchanged Target Price of RM25.00 (22x CY21 P/E)
Given the in-line results, we make no changes to our FY20-22F EPS. Our ADD call and Target Price of RM25.00 (pegged to 22x CY21 P/E, +0.5 s.d. above its 5-year mean) are also retained.
We continue to like Top Glove as the key beneficiary of the current favourable supply-demand dynamic in the glove sector due to the Covid-19 outbreak, given that it is largest glove maker by capacity (78.7bn pieces p.a. currently).
Key Highlights of Top Glove's Results Briefing
While Top Glove posted a record profit in 3QFY20, it expects its upcoming quartersto record new highs in terms of quarterly earnings.
Top Glove plans to continue to ramp up its new capacity due to overwhelming demand following the global Covid-19 pandemic.
The company also highlighted that it expects higher glove demand from Europe, US and Latin America in the coming quarters, as the Covid-19 outbreak has worsened in these regions.
Top Glove is allocating 20% of total capacity to spot orders going forward, given the strong demand for ad-hoc gloves. We gather that spot prices for gloves are at least 2-3x of recurring orders.
Top Glove is of the view that glove demand will sustain for at least the next 1-2 years. This is given that there is still no vaccine found for Covid-19 at this juncture, while the mass production of a vaccine, once that is developed, will still take time to implement.
As at end-3QFY8/20, Top Glove sits on a net cash of RM279m. It expects its net cash position to improve in tandem with higher net cash flows from operating activities.
As at 10 Jun 2020, some 64% of its convertible bonds have been converted to shares. Upon full conversion of all convertible bonds, it expects annual interest savings of RM30.5m. Note that our EPS forecast is based on an enlarged share base of 2.7bn, which would have included the full conversion of the exchangeable bonds and exercise of ESOS.
In 3QFY20, Aspion posted a net profit of RM34.3m (up by more than 436% y-o-y) on the back of higher glove sales, increase in ASPs and better efficiencies.
Moving forward, Top Glove expects raw material prices to increase slightly due to limited supply. However, it still expects to record margin expansion as the quantum of ASP increase will be more than sufficient to offset the higher raw material costs.

  在今天交易的午休时段，TOPGLOV（7113）公布了他们FY 2020 Q3 的业绩，并且盈利暴涨了365.94%！在开市后股价一度冲上 RM 18.00，然后就一路下滑了，相信这一轮庄家收割了不少韭菜.. 那今天我们除了探讨为什么 TOPGLOV 会下跌之外，也正经的分析一下他们这个季度的财报吧！
  不过在那之前，我们先看看公司的一些重点数值：
  营业额（Revenue）+ 41.85%
营业利润（Profit from Operations）+ 312.68%
净利（Net Profit）+ 365.94%
净利率（Net Profit Margin）+ 228.71%* 
  *公司的净利率从同个季度对比的6.27% 上涨到了20.61%，原因相信大家都知道了吧
  9M 营业现金流（Cash Flow from Operation）+ 218.87%
  在季报里面，管理层提到了他们的手套的销售额提高了 24%，并且在这个季度TOPGLOV 正式成为了全世界最大的丁腈手套（Nitrile Gloves）制造商！他们已经把HARTA（5168）拉下马，而除了丁腈手套之外，TOPGLOV 在Latex Powdered / Power-Free 手套，还有Surgical Glove 都是全球最大的生产商，这一步加深了TOPGLOV 霸占市场份额的实力啊！
  另外，从这个季度的Corporate Presentation 当中，他们提到了FY 2020 累积的 9个月的产品组合已经有50% 是比较高Margin 的Nitrile Gloves 组成的，有17% 是属于 Latex Powdered，19% 属于Latex Powder Free，以及10% 是属于 Surgical Gloves 的
同时间，TOPGLOV 也有在季报里面表示他们的Delivery Lead Time 从原本的 40天提升到了400天，也就是说你今天Order 的话最迟需要以400天后才可以拿到手套，不过根据市场传言他们也把部分的Capacity 用于应付高Margin 的订单，整体的Utilization Rate 也从上个对比季度的85% 提升到了95% 以上
  如果我们看公司的发展计划的话，会发现他们在2021 年年头就会增加36条新的生产线，或者说一共增加了 10 Billion 左右的手套生产Capacity，其中有8.3 Billion 是专注于生产Nitrile 手套，不知道HARTA 会如何迎击TOPGLOV 吃掉他们的市场份额呢？这个我看要等到HARTA 季报出炉才知道了
  而我比较担心的原料问题 – Nitrile Latex 以及 Natural Rubber Latex 各占了44% - 45% 的成本，目前他们9个月累计的成本计算是Nitrile 价格是 USD 1.00 / KG，而Latex 则是 RM 4.39 / KG，不过管理层有提到一个重点，那就是就算未来成本提高也好，他们也可以把成本转移给顾客，之前也有一些投资者朋友跟我一起讨论手套到底属于Commodities 没有，我想现在答案就是 – 有能力转移成本的手套公司就不算Commodities 吧！
  除了上面提到的因素之外，TOPGLOV 今天也派发了一个 RM 0.100 的Interim Dividend（FY 2019 全年股息也不过是 RM 0.075 而已），是用于奖励投资者的，这也基本上是在跟大家说他们的现金很强劲啦~
  Ok，讲完该讲的了，现在我们来吹水，为什么业绩那么好股价还会跌叻？基本上今天是大户们套利的好日子，不要忘记在你考虑要不要买入的时候，这些大户早就在 RM 10 以下的成本累计了不少 TOPGLOV 的股份，再加上近期我们也看到他们的Exchangeable Bonds 有大量转换成母股的的举动，这也相信是之前他们举债的人套利啦
  基本上这次的业绩是超乎分析员的估计的，理应股价会冲天吧？而今天就有不少新手被卷在 RM 18.00 左右的价位，我希望这只是庄家洗盘的动作而已，或许也因为整体大市不好，大家一起套利？
  无论如何，个人认为这次手套股的水有点深，之前巨赚的或许可以调整一下投资组合了，而我本身已经出售完毕手套股的部署（两天前的文章我有提到其中的原因了，大家可以去看看），希望大家接下来可以小心交易！
  最后，今天某家公司宣布了要收购一家手套公司因而股价暴涨，我想说目前市场主要需要到的是医疗手套，至于这家公司到底是卖工业用手套还是医疗手套的，大家可以去查询一下，我也不要说太多，费事又被人鸟

I believe it will help to pull up the share prices of the other glove manufacturers namely Comfort, Supermax etc. As I said before “rising tide lifts all boats”.
The only reason for Comfort and Supermax to plunge in the last few days is that many investors are forced to sell to meet margin call. Forced selling is a vicious cycle. The more they sold, the more the share price would drop-thus be creating more selling. Moreover, big players are pushing the price down so that they can buy at cheaper prices.
The safest strategy is to buy and wait patiently.  
KUALA LUMPUR, June 11 ― Top Glove Corporation Bhd’s net profit surged 365.92 per cent to an all-time high of RM347.90 million for the third quarter ended May 31, 2020 (Q3 2020) versus RM74.67 million in the same period last year.
Revenue jumped 42 per cent to RM1.69 billion from RM1.19 billion previously.
In a filing with Bursa Malaysia today, the world’s largest manufacturer of natural rubber gloves and surgical gloves attributed the group's extraordinary performance to unparalleled growth in sales volume on the back of the Covid-19 pandemic.
“Monthly sales orders went up by some 180 per cent resulting in long lead times, which went up from 40 days to around 400 days, whereby orders placed now would only be delivered over a year later,” it said.
In a separate statement, Top Glove said the Q3 2020 performance is the most outstanding in the company’s 29-year history.
For the nine-month period ended May 31, 2020 (9M 2020), the company’s net profit was RM575.0 million versus RM290.51 million in the same period a year ago, while revenue stood at RM4.13 billion from RM3.61 billion previously.
Following the marked increase in glove demand from virtually every country in the world, Top Glove said its utilisation rate rose to above 95 per cent in Q3 2020 versus 85 per cent in the pre-Covid 19 period, resulting in greater efficiency and economies of scale.
“Additional capacity which came on stream in Q3 2020 enabled the group to meet demand growth, while upward revisions in average selling prices in line with prevailing market prices were also affected,” it said.
As at May 31, 2020, Top Glove’s financial position improved significantly, with a net cash position of RM279 million compared with net borrowings in Q2 2020. This has enabled the group to fund capital expenditure (CAPEX) requirements.
“To this end, Top Glove has earmarked RM3 billion for CAPEX to build 450 new lines, creating new capacity of 60 billion pieces of gloves from 2020 to 2026,” it said.
Moving forward, Top Glove said it would continue to expand its capacity to ensure it is well-positioned to fulfil global glove demand, which is expected to grow to 12-15 per cent per annum post-Covid-19 from a pre-Covid 19 level of 8-10 per cent per annum, backed by increased usage in both the medical and non-medical sectors, as well as heightened hygiene awareness. ― Bernama

这也是该集团29年以来的最佳业绩纪录。
第三季营业额增41.85%至16亿8832万4000令吉，销量增25%，使首9个月营收增14.26%至41亿2720万1000令吉。
派息10仙
顶级手套每股派10仙或总派2亿6200万令吉股息，派息较2019财政年增长186%；6月25日除权，7月9日付款。
同时，顶级手套凌厉扩展，目前也跻身全球丁腈手套最大制造商。此前已是最大天然胶与医疗手套最大制造商。
疫情驱动
每月订单暴涨180%
该集团文告指出，疫情促使手套销量增长，每月销售订单暴涨180%，这导致交货期需等上40至400天；目前下单则可能需等待至一年后。
“顶级手套尽量分配产能至每一国与地区，确保有需要者用于救人，原有客户也获优先照顾。”
紧随全球需求增长，该集团产能使用率已从85%，增至第三季的95%，具更大效益与规模，迎合需求增长，平均销售价也走高。
该集团执行主席丹斯里林伟才对卓越表现感欣慰，在严峻时机而有良好表现，这归功于数十年奠定的坚实基础和胜任而专注的队伍，一路改善包含自动化、数码化、素质与成本效益等营运系统。
“手套是战胜疫情的必需品，保护全国、全球免于病毒感染是优先任务，此非常时期将继续安全而有效地生产更多手套。”
成综指STI最佳表现股
该集团另一殊荣，是崛起为隆综指（KLCI）与新加坡海峡时报指数（STI）最佳表现股，股价各飙涨263%与268%；截至6月10日崛起为马第六大市值公司，新加坡第十二大市值公司。
该集团继续扩大产能，从疫情前的8至10%，调整至疫情后的每年12至15%产能增长，配合手套广泛使用于医疗与非医疗等大趋势。
该集团鉴定30亿令吉作为扩建第450新生产线用途，从2020至2026年将增600亿个手套产能。
在万津42厂房的顶级手套创意大厦（TGIC），亦是集团新的研发与卓越中心；这是精明与数码化生产设施，有工业4.0科技、大数据分析，优化生产与程序效益，减少依赖外劳。
这个“未来厂房”首期，预料2022年第二季建成，以后厂房以此为蓝本。
持2.7亿净现金
截至3月杪集团有净现金2亿7900万令吉，相比次季为净贷款，这足以融资资本开销。
集团也拨500万令吉作为防疫与慈善用途，另300万令吉捐助大马医院、政府部门、警方与隆慈济等组织。同时，发恩俸金于国内外工人。
展望未来，该集团认为来季料受强劲需求、高产能支撑，集团继续专注创新、素质与成效，1年订单在手，有信心为2020与2021财政年捎来佳绩。
林伟才表示：“尽管强劲订单与良好表现，目前不是自满时候，需持续力争上游保住增长势头。”

  During today webinar, Tan Sri Lim share this information.
Top Glove Corporation Bhd expects better earnings in its current year ending 2020 (FY20) backed by the recent rise in ad hoc and spot orders by government agencies and global market demand. 
It sales would likely double in its current fourth quarter, driven by higher average selling prices (ASP).
It is now guiding for a monthly double-digit ASP increase at least for the next few months.
Top Glove envisions ""extremely"" robust quarters ahead, driven by strong demand growth, high utilisation and additional capacity coming onstream.
Following the increase in glove demand from virtually every country in the world, the group's utilisation rate rose from a pre-Covid level of 85 per cent to above 95 per cent in Q3.

Raw material prices fell during the quarter (NBR: -10% qoq, -14% yoy; NR: -1% qoq, -4% yoy). Together with overall lower operating expenses, TG’s PATMI margin improved to 20.6% (+11.2ppts qoq, 14.3ppts yoy).
 Key highlights. Utilization rate >95% with significantly longer order lead time up to 1H2021 (Nitrile glove: 14 months, Natural Rubber: 13 months, Surgical: 5 months, Vinyl: 6 months). Top Glove has the largest extra capacity compared to its peers with plans to increase capacity to 86.4bn pcs p.a. (+c.22% yoy) by end of 2020. (refer table 2). An amount of RM3bn in capex allocation for expansion in CY2020 to CY2026 includes the construction of Top Glove Innovation Complex (TGIC), a smart and digitalised manufacturing plant (to be completed by 2QCY2022).
Against estimates: Inline. 9MFY20 PATMI of RM575m, making up 61.7% of our full year forecast is considered in-line as we are expecting higher 4QFY20 performance.
Higher DPS. An interim DPS of 10 sen was declared (vs 3QFY19: 3.5sen). We expect full year DPS of 18sen, translating into dividend yield of 1.1% and payout of 50%.
Outlook: Long term strong demand to persist. The business outlook for Top Glove is secured for the next 12 months with order book filled. As for longer term, uncertainties with regards to virus resurgence as well as when can the pandemic be contained would ensure continued strong demand for gloves. Greater hygiene and healthcare awareness brought about by Covid-19 have created a new normal for higher usage of glove in the future with demand to show a growth rate of up to 12% post Covid from pre-Covid c.8-10%. There is a potentially higher-than expected earnings growth on increase demand and stronger ASP, in our view. We gathered from management that from June onwards, ASP could rise c.15% mom up till Aug, including higher ASP of c. 3x for Ad hoc sales (allocated up to 20% of overall capacity).
Our call. We maintain our earnings forecast with TP RM20.50 based on unchanged PER of 38x pegged on FY21 EPS. We like Top Glove due to i) largest extra capacity compared to its peers, ii) higher ASP increase among OEM players as the company is a major supplier with a diversified customer base, and iii) strong management.

KUALA LUMPUR (June 11): Set to release its third-quarter results later this evening, selling pressure continued on shares in Top Glove Corp Bhd.
Earlier this morning, the rubber glove maker made headways by reaching new heights as investors anticipate better earnings figures for Top Glove's third financial quarter ended May 31, 2020 (3QFY20), during which the Covid-19 virus was spreading rapidly worldwide. The World Health Organization declared the outbreak a pandemic in March.
Top Glove's share price was up by as much as 48 sen or 2.81% to a high of RM17.56 — tripling since the start of this year, before it pared some of its gains and was down 28 sen or 1.64% to RM16.80 at 11am. This values Top Glove at RM44.55 billion.
CGS-CIMB Research analyst Walter Aw, in a note dated June 9, expected Top Glove's net profit to more than double year-on-year as well as quarter-on-quarter, which is to be driven by higher sales volume and average selling prices.
However, he viewed that the profit jump was yet to capture the full impact of the surge in glove demand caused by the pandemic as Aw saw stronger growth ahead for the glove maker.
The other big brother, Hartalega Holdings Bhd, seems to be the clear leader among the peers by going up 20 sen or 1.61% to RM12.66 at 11am, while Kossan was unchanged at RM9.08.
Supermax Corp Bhd, on the other hand, declined 14 sen or 0.12% to RM8.55, followed by Careplus Group Bhd, which slipped seven sen or 4.46% to RM1.50, and Comfort Gloves Bhd, which was 21 sen or 6.48% lower at RM3.03.

马银行研究指出，一些紧急需要用手套的现货客户，愿意以3倍或4倍价格获取手套（每千个为100至120美元）；这些现货买家包括政府部门、非政府组织、发货商或者临时的零售买家。行管过后经济重新开放是促成手套需求走高主因（除了医疗以外，餐饮与零售业需求高）。
一些手套商也大胆调高平均零售价，6月至7月间按月调高10%至15%售价。
马银行指出，基于疫情和防感染考量，餐饮与肉类处理行业也使用密度更高的医疗手套，该行相信经销商对非医疗客户调更高售价。
顶级手套今公布业绩
顶级手套（TOPGLOV,7113,主板医疗保健组）将于11日公布第三季业绩（3至5月），预期将显示是手套股首个上升期，这股爆升之势持续至2020年下半年。
马银行调高贺特佳（HARTA,5168,主板医疗保健组）2021财政年（3月杪截止）财测40%、30%与9%，并认为现货手套订单可在下半年作贡献。
在零售与药剂行的丁腈检查手套，平均售价每千个达150至240美元，赚幅高达80至200%。
大马全球手套市占达65%（包括顶级手套24%、贺特佳12%、高产9%、速柏玛（SUPERMX,7106,主板医疗保健组）7%）、泰国19%、中国11%，规模庞大生产商在供应吃紧期间有议价能力。
马银行认为在未来3个季度，顶级手套在高平均售价和凌厉扩产下，要比贺特佳与高产表现更好。
上周，顶级手套产能增长7%至年产787亿个手套。
马银行预期2020年与2021年产能成长17%与27%，顶级手套将出现创纪录的高营运盈利赚幅。
联昌研究调高顶级手套2020至2022财政年每股盈利51至189%，预期3个财政年平均售价增长15%、35%及萎缩30%。
基于产能大效应，看好顶级手套是疫情下供需利好的主要受惠者；维持“加码”目标价以2021年22倍本益比计，从16令吉50仙调高至20令吉。
马银行指出，首选股顶级手套今年股本回酬要比同侪高（达43%），相比贺特佳的30%与25%，主要是资本开销低（原厂址已有基建），而且产能全开（从85%开足）。
分析员说，贺特佳（HARTA,5168,主板医疗保健组）和高产柅品（KOSSAN,7153,主板医疗保健组）客户群类似，同样有很多分销商大客户向医院供应手套，并不能随意调高平均售价，但可对小客户更显著调高售价。
售价可增长50%
该行预期下半年售价调整更迅猛，高产柅品表示价格可增长50%（不包括现货价）；建议“买进”高产柅品，目标价10令吉95仙。
贺特佳2021至2023财政年每股盈利调高40%、30%与9%，预期平均售价可调高至2020年第四季，至于现货价贡献可延续至今年下半年。维持“守住”评级，目标价调高34%至12令吉15仙。

Top Glove has received a surge in demand, with ASP increases along with spot orders (10% of volume, priced 2-3x higher). We take the opportunity to increase our FY20-22 earnings by 22%/65%/50% to reflect expectation of higher ASPs (c. +6% YoY) and higher demand with improved utilization (almost full capacity till 2021). Post earnings adjustments, our TP increases to RM19.80 (from RM13.50). Our TP is based on mid FY21 earnings pegged to PE multiple of 38x (2SD above 5 year mean). We maintain BUY and retain as our sector top pick.
Growth in coming quarters. Heavily driven by Covid-19, we foresee strong demand in the coming quarters (c. 30% vs. normalized 8-10% growth YoY). Furthermore, with no vaccine found and health experts are of opinion that it would take 12-18 months for a vaccine to be developed, we believe demand for gloves would remain robust. Being the largest glove manufacturer in the world, commanding 26% of global market share, we feel Top Glove remains in pole position to benefit from this as it has seen a surge in orders in tandem with the current strong global glove demand. Its usual pre-Covid- 19 lead time of 1-1.5 months has risen to c.11 months in mid-May and has currently extended to beyond 12 months. Moreover, with the recent riots in US, risk of Covid-19 clusters arising from there cannot be discounted. Note that glove consumption from US is the highest at 150 pieces per capita (vs. Germany: 141 pcs/capita, Italy: 123 pcs/capita, Europe: 100 pcs/capita); Top Glove’s distribution to North America is the highest (1HFY20 sales volume to US stood at 26%).
ASP. We understand ASP has exhibited upward pressure (more than 15% since Feb), and we expect the upward trend to sustain until year end. Utilisation rate pre Covid-19 stood at 85%, but has now increased to full capacity (c. 97%); we expect this to remain at this level until 2021. Apart from that, Top Glove has also been receiving spot orders (i.e. urgent orders that are can be placed at higher price). These spot orders are 2-3x more than normal ASPs depending on urgency. Spot orders makes up roughly 10% of Top Glove’s sales volume.
Expansion. Despite the MCO/CMCO, Top Glove’s expansion plan is on track. By end of 2020 Top Glove will have a total capacity of 86.4bn pieces (c.+22%YoY). Additionally, Top Glove has explored into diversifying their product range to face masks (capacity of 110m pieces per annum). To date, it is on track, with targeted commencement in June 2020.
Forecast. We take this opportunity to upgrade our FY20-22 earnings by 22%/65%/50% to reflect in better profitability, drive by further increase our assumption on ASPs (c. +6% YoY) and utilization (to run at full capacity at least until 2021). We hope to see more visibility with the release of 3QFY20 result that is being set on 11 June.
Maintain BUY, TP RM19.80. We maintain BUY with higher TP of RM19.80 (from RM13.50). Post earnings adjustments, our TP increases to RM19.80 (from RM13.50). Our TP is based on mid FY21 pegged against PE multiple of 38x (2SD above 5 year mean). We maintain BUY and retain as our top pick for the sector.

  KUALA LUMPUR (June 10): Top Glove Corp Bhd, whose share price has more than tripled year to date, ascended to fresh peak at RM17.20 in early morning trade. But selling pressure started to surface soon after that, indicating investors are holding the horses ahead of its quarterly result announcement tomorrow.
At the noon break, Top Glove closed at RM16.86, down 14 sen or 0.9%. There were 7.39 million shares traded in the morning session. The stock was mostly been hovering in the negative territory in the morning session.
All eyes are on Top Glove's earnings figures for the third financial quarter ended May 31, 2020 (3QFY20), during which the Covid-19 virus was spreading globally. The World Health Organization declared the outbreak a pandemic in March.
CGS-CIMB Research expects Top Glove's net profit to more than double year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter, which is to be driven by higher sales volume and average selling prices (ASPs).
Still, the profit jump has yet to capture the full impact of the surge in glove demand caused by the pandemic. The stock brokerage anticipates stronger growth ahead.
""However, we believe that 3QFY20 did not capture the full impact of Covid-19 as it only began to hike ASPs aggressively from June 20. Hence, Top Glove should continue to record sequentially stronger results beyond 3QFY20,"" said CGS-CIMB in a note dated June 9.
""We continue to like Top Glove as the key beneficiary of the current favourable supply and demand dynamics in the glove sector due to Covid-19 given it is the largest glovemaker globally by capacity (78.7 billion pieces per annum currently),"" it added.
CGS-CIMB pegs its target price at RM25 — the highest among investment analysts who track the company. Following the forecast, this means there is 48% headroom from the current level.
CGS-CIMB Research forecast Top Glove's net profit to soar to RM1.37 billion for the full financial year ending Aug 31, 2020 (FY20) and RM3.7 billion for FY21, with revenue at RM6.79 billion for FY20 and RM10.72 billion for FY21.
CGS-CIMB foresees Top Glove to continue seeing firm demand for gloves as the Covid-19 pandemic worsens, especially in countries with high population density and low glove consumption per capita, such as Brazil, Indonesia, Pakistan and others.
According to Bloomberg data, 19 out of the 22 research firms have ""buy"" calls, with six analysts having target prices of RM20 and over.
Other analysts that have target prices above RM20 are Credit Suisse's Joanna Cheah with RM23, followed by BIMB Securities Sdn Bhd's Saffa Amanina and Macquarie's Denise Soon with RM20.50 each, Kenanga Research's Raymond Choo with RM20.10 and Maybank Kim Eng's Lee Yen Ling — who was the first to upgrade her target price to RM20.
Maybank's Lee is expecting Top Glove's FY20 net profit to be at RM1.14 billion and RM3.17 billion for the following financial year, while revenue is projected to be at RM6.52 billion for FY20 and RM10.61 billion for FY21.

However after just 10 minutes one can sense that there were more people waiting to sell than people dying to buy. You can see that via what we call price action. Of course some syndicates will park and do funny stuff and churn, but try to learn to note the price action to learn about the character of the stock for the day.

Much of the trepidation surrounding glove makers is the upcoming quarters results by Top Glove come Thursday. It is going to be a significant moment for glove makers. A superb performance will further add fuel and optimism for the rest. A meeting of expectations alone will attract only profit takers and a lack of fresh buyers.

In situation as such we have to ask: if the results are above expectations, who else will come in to buy?; if the results sufficient to generate enough confidence that the current HOLDERS would largely choose not to sell and wait for higher levels; if its below expectations well, be in for a swift pullback.

Hartalega's recent quarterly, how was it? It was tepid. It has to be noted that it was for the 3 months ended March 2020, hence it did not get to reflect much of the upsurge in orders. 

HARTA








SUPERMAX







A better gauge has to be Supermax quarterly results which was announced on 20th May 2020. Supermax appears to have included some of the uptick in ASP (average selling price) in the quarterly. This made Hartalega's financials look bad in comparison.  While revenue only jumped from RM385m to RM447m (+16%), PBT jumped from RM41.8m to RM95.2m (+170%). The resultant quarterly EPS was 5.42 sen. If you annualised that = 21.68 sen, at share price of RM8.88, PER will be just 41x. If we tag on a realistic 30% uptick for 21.68 = 28.1 sen = PER 31x. Totally reasonable being a favoured sector with a new normal of demand in store.

Now's the turn of the bellwether Top Glove, its quarterly to be announce on Thursday. Its for the quarter ended May 2020. Top Glove prides itself for being one of the swiftest to announce their quarterly. However 11th June was an even faster date compared to previous quarters: 17 Dec and 19 Mar. It has to be probable very good news that Top Glove wanted to shout it out to the world. Bearing in mind it has an additional two months of heady business compared to Supermax, analysts have been quite positive.

So what would be a decent expectation. The way Top Glove's price has been behaving around RM16-17 indicates that we are factoring at least 150%-200% jump in NP. Previous quarter's NP was RM116m, hence expectations will be around RM290m-348m or EPS of 11.3 sen - 13.5 sen. Annualise that = 45.2 sen - 54 sen. At RM18.00, PER would be 39.8x - 33x. Still within the realm of reasonableness. If we do not get RM280m in net profit, I suspect there will be a sharper sell down back to RM13.00-RM14.00. If its higher than RM360m, that should pave the way to march past RM20.00.

  KUALA LUMPUR (June 9): Profit taking emerged among rubber glove stocks, pushing some into negative territory today. 
Supermax Corp Bhd soared to an all-time high of RM9.30 in the morning. Selling pressure surfaced, pulling the share price to a day’s low of RM8.61 before it closed at RM8.65, down 23 sen or 2.6%, with 24.75 million shares traded. 
The lower liners, namely Comfort Gloves Bhd, Careplus Group Bhd and Rubberex Corp (M) Bhd, were hit harder. Comfort Gloves dropped 23 sen or 6.3% to RM3.40, while Careplus, which released its quarterly results last Friday, fell seven sen, or 4.3%, to RM1.56. Rubberex shed 18 sen, or nearly 5%, to RM3.45. 
Careplus and Rubberex were the two best performers among glove counters listed on Bursa Malaysia, followed by Supermax and Comfort Gloves, with gains of more than 900% and 500% year to date.
Analysts said retail investors and traders were locking some profit after the strong rally.  
However, the big boys managed to hold onto the ground and climbed higher.
Top Glove Corp Bhd continued its steady climb to a fresh peak today. It closed at a new record high of RM17 as analysts kept raising their target prices. The latest was CGS-CIMB, lifting its target price to RM25. The stock brokerage anticipates Top Glove to achieve a net profit of RM1.37 billion for the financial year ending Aug 31, 2020 (FY20) and RM3.7 billion for FY21. 
Top Glove is expected to release its financial results this week. 
The two other glove stocks that also ended in the green territory were Hartalega Holdings Bhd and Kossan Rubber Industries Bhd, gaining 2.62% to RM12.52 and 1.67% to RM9.13 respectively.
A total of 17.67 million Hartalega shares were traded, valuing the company at RM42.38 billion. Kossan saw 7.6 million units changing hands, giving it a market capitalisation of RM11.68 billion.
Last week, Maybank Kim Eng head of regional equity research Anand Pathmakanthan said the craze for rubber glove shares amid the Covid-19 pandemic was nowhere near the end just yet.
The strong interest, according to him, was not just a simple cyclical phenomenon, but a structural step up for the sector in terms of demand as well as pricing.
""It is a multi-year story for glove makers, and not just a blip,"" he said, adding that while the cyclical element of the rubber glove sector was obvious, the market may have missed that the sector also has a structural element to it.

We expect Top Glove to post a record FY21 net profit of RM3.7bn, backed by aggressive ASP growth (+35% y-o-y) and higher sales volume (+25.6% y-o-y).
Reiterate ADD, with a higher Target Price of RM25.00 (22x CY21 P/E).
Widening Lead Time a Sign of Stronger-than-expected Glove Demand
Top Glove says that its order lead time further extended at end-May 2020 by > 12 months to up to Jul 21 (from 10 months at end-Apr 20). This is on the back of higher demand from both developed (70% of global glove consumption) as well as developing countries.
We expect Top Glove to continue to see higher demand for gloves as the Covid-19 pandemic worsens, especially in countries with high population density and low glove consumption per capita, such as Brazil, Indonesia, Pakistan, etc.
Higher Blended ASPs Due to Increase in Prices of Ad-hoc Orders
Given the long lead time for glove orders, Top Glove has seen an increase in ad-hoc orders. These orders are from customers that urgently need supply of gloves and who are willing to pay substantially higher selling prices (potentially 2-3x of ASPs for recurring orders) in order to obtain glove supply faster.
Given the strong ad-hoc demand, we gather that Top Glove has currently allocated up to 10% (and potentially more if needed) of its total capacity to cater to these orders.
Expect Sequentially Stronger Results From 3QFY20 Onwards
Top Glove is set to release its 3QFY8/20 results on 11 June 20 and we believe it recorded > 100% y-o-y and q-o-q increases in 3QFY20 net profit. This was likely driven by higher sales volume and ASPs. However, we believe that 3QFY20 did not capture the full impact of Covid-19 as it only began to hike ASPs aggressively from June 20. Hence, Top Glove should continue to record sequentially stronger results beyond 3QFY20.
Lifting Top Glove's FY20 EPS by 51-189%
We raise our FY20-22F EPS by 51-189%, mainly to factor in more aggressive ASP assumptions and higher utilisation rates. Our earnings forecasts assume ASP changes of +15%/+35%/-30% y-o-y in FY20/21/22F on the back of hikes in ASPs for both recurring and ad-hoc orders, which we also expect to increase.
Our sensitivity analysis shows that a 1% rise in ASPs will lift our FY20-22F EPS estimate by 5.8-7.6%.
Reiterate ADD, With a Higher Target Price of RM25.00 (22x CY21 P/E)
In tandem with our EPS hike, our Target Price rises to RM25.00, pegged to 22x CY21 P/E, +0.5 s.d. above its 5-year mean. Note that we lower our P/E multiple from 36.8x (+2 s.d. of its 5-year mean) as we believe that its earnings will peak in FY21 and that the high demand is unlikely to sustain going into FY22.
We continue to like Top Glove as the key beneficiary of the current favourable supply and demand dynamics in the glove sector due to COVID-19 given it is the largest glove maker globally by capacity (78.7bn pieces p.a. currently).

Top Glove’s earnings surging more than double in 3QFY20
Tuesday, June 9th, 2020  at , Markets | News
by SHAHEERA AZNAM SHAH/ pic by TMR FILE
DECLINING global rubber prices coupled with rising selling prices of Top Glove Corp Bhd’s finished products could lift the world’s largest rubber glove manufacturer’s earnings in the current financial period.
Top Glove could see its net profit surging as much as 88% for the third quarter ended May 31, 2020 (3QFY20), said RHB Research.
“Top Glove’s earnings are expected to more than double in 3QFY20 compared to the previous quarter, driven by the higher average selling price (ASP), strong volume growth, the better exchange between the US dollar and the ringgit, and lower raw material prices.
“Note that the impact of higher ASPs is extremely strong on earnings. We expect Top Glove’s 3QFY20 earnings to surge 88% to RM218 million from RM116 million in 2QFY20,” it said in a recent note.
Glove demand, which is already hitting the roof amid the Covid-19 pandemic and continued to increase throughout May, allows Top Glove to enjoy the highest ASP increase among original equipment manufacturer players due to its customer diversification.
This is caused by the group’s higher pricing power as a major supplier to a diversified customer base, in which each client orders in smaller volumes.
The company’s biggest customer contributes less than 4% to its sales, while the group also has a more balanced product mix to offer to a different range of customers, RHB Research noted.
“Due to the positive factors, we expect an outstanding 3QFY20 result for the company. Our target price implies a 35.8 times forecast for price-earnings ratio for the financial year ending Aug 31, 2021 (FY21), close to the 36 times sector average.”
It said the glovemaker’s orders are secured up to July 2021, while the utilisation rate of its factories is now nearly full at between 90% and 95% compared to the normal levels of 80%-85% before Covid-19.
Meanwhile, the group’s latest lead time during this period increased to 13 months compared to 10 months in April.
According to the glove producer’s sales breakdown, its nitrile gloves margin is expected to be more stable compared to other rubber products, owing to higher prices for nitrile gloves as these are sold to developed countries.
Top Glove will release its 3QFY20 financial results on Thursday, it told Bursa Malaysia last week.
The group’s revenue and net profit expanded 36% and 38.6% respectively in FY10 as demand soared at the start of the 2009-2010 H1N1 pandemic, AmInvestment Bank Bhd wrote in a recent note.
“We believe Top Glove is one of the largest beneficiaries of the Covid-19 pandemic due to its highly diversified customer base, which allows the company more freedom for selling price adjustments,” AmInvest added.

The pandemic has caused a structural change in demand for gloves, so earnings at some makers will double in each of the next two years and drive their stocks to outperform, according to Ross Cameron, a fund manager at Northcape, which overseas about $7 billion in assets globally.
“The duration of super-normal demand is still longer than most people realize, ” Cameron said. Factors that will continue to support the share rally include product price increases and the fact many nations are ill prepared for pandemics, he said.
Shares of the world’s biggest glove makers Top Glove and Hartalega, both listed on Malaysia’s bourse, have soared 257% and 136% this year, respectively, making them the top gainers in MSCI Inc.’s broadest gauges of stocks listed in Asia and emerging markets.
Their rally has vaulted the two firms into the list of top companies in Malaysia and driven their valuations into uncharted territory.
Northcape, an Australia-headquartered asset manager that has been investing in the shares of glove makers for more than a decade, bought more glove-makers’ shares early this year “when signs emerged that Covid-19 would become a global pandemic, ” Cameron said.
According to his calculations, Top Glove will generate average earnings growth of more than 100% for each of the next two years while Hartalega will also deliver “exceptionally strong” earnings growth as personal protective equipment purchases increase globally.
Some glove makers have “an order backlog all the way out to June 2021, ” compared with one month before the pandemic, he said. The discovery of a vaccine to prevent Covid-19 disease will also help keep demand elevated because “glove companies and some experts have noted that the widespread administering of a vaccine will actually result in a further spike in glove demand, ” he added.
Shares in Top Glove and Hartalega are trading close to their record valuations based on 12-month forward estimated earnings, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Analyst price targets have failed to keep pace with rapid stock gains.
Cameron said that “analysts are still behind the curve in updating their estimates, which is why the stocks look expensive on a headline basis.”
Most of the analysts “still underestimate how high margins could go in this environment, ” he added.
Northcape’s earnings estimate for Top Glove for the fiscal year 2021 is more than 60% above the Bloomberg consensus estimate. This puts Top Glove on a forward price-to-earnings ratio of just 23 times, Cameron said. That compares with 37 times based on estimates of analysts tracked by Bloomberg.
“There are very few companies globally which can deliver anything close, ” he said.

Earnings are most sensitive to the changes in ASPs, compared to sales volume and costs. Prior to the ASP hikes in Mar 2020, we estimate that every 1% increase in medical glove ASP would result in 5-8% increase in net profits for stocks under our coverage. Additionally, the reopening of economies may exacerbate the acute shortage with the emergence of new glove users (retail, F&B, airlines) and the potential COVID-19 second wave.
Our top pick is Top Glove (BUY, Target Price MYR20.00) for its steeper ASP hikes and faster sales volume growth.
Earnings Explosion in the Coming Quarters
2Q20 will mark the beginning of the ASP up-cycle with Top Glove scheduled to release its 3QFY8/20 results (Mar-May) on 11 Jun. We believe all glove players will see stronger earnings in 2Q20 and the bigger explosion will take place in 2H20.
For Top Glove and Kossan, we maintain our BUY ratings, target prices and earnings forecasts. As for Hartalega, we raise our FY3/21-23E EPS by 40%/30%/9% as we extend the ASP hikes until 4Q20 (from 3Q20 previously) and also include the contribution from the spot orders in 2H20. Consequently, our target price for Hartalega is now raised to MYR12.15 (+34%; 41x CY21E P/E) and the stock remains a HOLD.
US Market: Inventories and Latest Retail ASPs
Gloves out of stock in US
The severe shortage can be seen on the websites of the healthcare distributors (eg. Medline), retailers (eg. Amazon, Walmart) and pharmacies (eg. Walgreens, Bartell Drugs, CVS, Rite Aid). For the medical grade nitrile exam gloves, these websites have listed the nitrile exam gloves as “out of stock”. Though certain nitrile exam gloves are available on some of these websites, these are largely limited to the odd-sized gloves (i.e. extra-large).
ASP hikes by different players
For players that has more flexibility in raising ASPs (eg. Top Glove, Sri Trang Agro (SGX:NC2)), the confirmed ASPs for Jul 2020 is already > 40% higher than pre-COVID 19 level in Feb 2020.
As for players that have bigger exposure to the big distributors (eg. Hartalega, Kossan), we think the current blended ASP could also be > 10% higher than pre-COVID 19 level. This is because the big distributors only account for 30-50% of the sales volume, leaving the remaining 50-70% of volume available for faster upward ASP adjustments. Comparatively, none of Top Glove’s customer accounts for > 4% of its sales.
As for Supermax (a unique manufacturer-OBM player), the ASP hike is much steeper than the abovementioned OEM players. In addition to enjoying the ASP hikes at its manufacturing division, Supermax also streamlined its supply chain (eliminating all the middlemen), in order to maximize its profit. The management has guided that its ASPs (including distribution) has jumped 2.5x to USD150/k pieces (from USD60/k pieces before COVID-19).
Our ASP assumptions
Our CY20E blended ASP assumptions are more aggressive for Top Glove (+24%), compared to our blended ASP assumptions for Hartalega (CY20E: +8%) and Kossan (+9%). In our view, Top Glove has a more diverse customer base which gives it more leeway to push through steeper ASP hikes. Moreover, it is the biggest OEM player in the sector (24% global market share) and hence, it could be leading the sector in ASP hikes.
Additionally, we have also assumed for a higher spot ASP of USD100/k pieces for Top Glove (present spot ASP is USD100-120/k pieces) and only USD50/k pieces for Hartalega and Kossan, as we try to be more conservative on the latter. For the 3 stocks under our coverage, we have assumed for 10% of sales volume derived from the spot market in 2H20.
Our blended ASP assumptions have also assumed for zero ASP hikes and zero spot orders from 1Q21 onwards. Though some of the glove players have the policies of raising their ASPs by 5% every month into 1H21, we await for higher certainty before raising our ASPs further.
Prior to the ASP hikes in Mar 2020, we estimate that every 1% increase in medical glove ASP would result in 5%/6%/8% increase in net profits for Hartalega/Kossan/Top Glove. However, after our exam glove ASP revisions which resulted in higher ASP base, every 1% increase in blended ASPs would result in 2%/3%/4% increase in our FY21E net profit for Top Glove/Hartalega/Kossan.
Top Glove: Potentially Doubling Its ASPs by Feb 2021
Given the long sales lead time of 12 months (until Jun 2021) and tight supply outlook in 2021, Top Glove is confident that its ASP hikes could sustain into 1H21. Assuming the pace of ASP hike for the normal orders maintains at 5% m-o-m from Aug 2020, we estimate that the nitrile glove ASP would double to USD46/k pieces by Feb 2021 (from pre-COVID level in Feb 2020). At ASP of USD46/k pieces, it would still be 50-60% lower than the present spot price.
Earnings Outlook and Valuations
Record high EBITDA margins and ROE
Our higher ASP assumptions have resulted in record high EBITDA margins in CY20E for all the glove stocks in our universe (refer Figure 14 in PDF report attached below). We project Top Glove’s EBITDA margin to jump to 31-33% in CY20-21E (from 18% in CY19) and significantly narrowed the gap against Hartalega (CY20-21E: 35-36%).
We also project Top Glove’s CY20E ROE to be significantly higher at 43%. This is much higher than our projected CY20E ROE of 30% and 25% for Hartalega and Kossan respectively. Top Glove’s ROE could be higher than its peers because:
the capex for its plants are lower (its factory sites do not require construction of basic infrastructure); and
higher plant utilization rate of almost 100% (from 85% previously).
Our Winner Pick: Top Glove
In terms of earnings growth in the coming 3 quarters, we think Top Glove will outperform Hartalega and Kossan due to Top Glove’s steeper ASP hikes and faster capacity growth.
In addition to the construction of new plants, the upgrading works (increase the production speed) at its old plants have also boosted its capacity. Just last week, Top Glove reported a capacity growth of 7% to 78.7b pcs p.a. (from 73.8b pcs a month ago) due to the completion of the upgrading works. We understand that the upgrading works started in 2018-19 and have already fully completed in Jun 2020. Management guided that there would be no more upgrading works in the near-term, and hence, there should be no sudden capacity jump anytime soon.
We now estimate Top Glove’s effective capacity growth to be 17% and 27% in CY20E and CY21E respectively. Though this is around 10% higher than our assumed effective capacity for FY21E, we maintain our earnings forecasts for now as it is already significantly higher than that of consensus. Based on our sensitivity analysis, every 1% increase in sales volume, will raise our FY21E net profit by 1%.
In our earnings model, we have only assumed for ASP hikes and spot orders until 1QFY21 (Sep-Nov 2020). However, assuming the ASP hikes for normal orders sustain until Jun 2021 (+5% m-o-m) and there is no more spot orders, our blended ASP for FY21E would be USD39/k pieces. This would be 19% higher than our assumed blended ASP of USD33/k pieces in FY21E. Refer figure 17 in PDF report attached below for our scenario analysis under the different ASP hike scenarios.
Top Glove’s upcoming 3QFY20 results (to release on 11 Jun) will mark the beginning of the ASP up-cycle
Top Glove’s upcoming 3QFY20 results (to release on 11 Jun, see Top Glove Announcements) will mark the beginning of the ASP up-cycle and we expect the earnings to continue to explode in 4QFY20-1QFY21. With the earnings materialising, the market may continue to re-rate Top Glove. This will also be supported by its record high EBITDA margin (CY20-21E: just a tad lower than that of Hartalega) and superior ROE (higher than Hartalega and Kossan).
We value Top Glove on CY21E P/E of 23x (+0.5 SD to 5-year mean). Our target P/E is lower than its trading range of 27-30x in 2018 (+1SD to 5-year mean) because we take into consideration of the potential sharp correction of earnings from FY22E. Additionally, our CY21E EPS is also derived from 8 months of FY21E EPS (supernormal earnings) and 4 months of FY22E EPS (normalization of earnings).
Top Glove currently trades at CY21E P/E of 20x, in line with its 5-year mean, but still lower than its two big-cap peers. Hartalega trades at CY21E P/E of 39x (close to its +1SD to mean of 41x) while Kossan trades at CY21E P/E of 23x (slightly above its 5-year mean of 22x). Refer figure 23 for the sector’s valuation comparison.

      WHAT KIM SAID ABOUT GLOVES SECTOR NOW?
  BULLISH & UPTRENDING 
  1. ""TOMORROW FLY TO RECORD A NEW HIGH AGAIN""
  1. - (Covid-19) 7,000,000 mil hits global cases. Heading to 10M.
2. - (Covid-19) 2,000,000 mil  hits Uncle Sam cases. Heading to double.
3. - KLCI flying with 40 intensive worth 35B.
4. - CMCO extended to 30 August by Govt.
5. - Top Glove done (ESOS) big amount. Refreshing and will lead all gloves movement.
6. - IB's will revise their new target after they done 2 days tricky. Accumulated lowest.
7. - I say time to aggressive fly. You wont get cheap prices on Gloves sector this June. Playing high target on gloves this week also awaiting excellent and superb Top Gloves result on Thursday.
    2. ""GRAB THIS OPPORTUNITY IN JUNE. NO CHEAP PRICES ON JULY""
  1. - Expect Covid-19 heading to 10,000,000 within another 3 months
2. - Expect Covid-19 heading to 5,000,000 within another 3 months
3. - Most Gloves cw's not expiring on June. So my predicting is another flying call warrants in the making
4. - Business allowed  to operate full capacity soon. Its mean Government had allowed rubber glove industry to run at full capacity and service providers as well as raw materials and packaging suppliers in the rubber glove industry can continue operating. So the production can fullfill all ordered and demand received. Its good move because Malaysia is expected to produce 220 billion pieces of rubber gloves this year.
    3. ""MARGIN LIMITING/CAPPING BY IB'S""
    1. - Good ideas from IB's by capping the margin account.
  I am forsee start from June all gloves movements will going stablize and continue to be next rally. Dont worries about ""Correction"" because correction always did when you are panics selling with no reason such like ""margin capping issue"". So on 1st and 2nd June, from my view, I just base on 2 big gloves. Top Glove and Harta. By looking at trend sell & buy. Both are defending at certain level, where i can see both are creating new supports and can't go lower. With Harta last minute big push gapped -12 bids. So i assume next day new support will be created again. So Harta will standback at @13.0 and Top Glove @15.0. However impossible the force sell to stop immediately but it still. So 70% of my view, I am forsees nextday will have a balancing before the force sell to stop.
    2. - Investment banks (IB'S) could have done this for two reasons :-
  Firstly, they feared glove overvalued. By then trying to avoid losses later by margin calls
Secondly, they are losing too much money in issuing too many glove call warrants. As call glove stocks continue going up while they are suffering tremendous losses from call warrants.
  So, from my view and my side they are playing something now, but I am not saying they are cheating but 'smarting"". Since Malaysia is a free market they should let free trading decide by limiting margin only showing banks are now weak and vulnerable.""Maybe"".
 
3. - What a Margin Capping's this? Just an example. Lets see 2 Ib's for study :
  A.  MayBank Investment Bank Bhd (Top Glove)
     Target Price : RM20.00
     Margin account Capping at RM9.41
  B.  RHB Investment Bank Bhd (Supermax)
     Target Price : RM10.50
      Margin a/c Capping at 35% or RM5.00
  So, I belief they issued too many European structure call warrant especially Supermax and Top Glove call warrant and never expect also imagine Supermax and Top Glove. Both gap up and flew sky high in a very short time and caught them off guard. So they take immediate action with tis new rules.
    4. So, for Me as I said :-
  1. ""Yes, It's Hot; But No, Your Gas Tank Won't Explode If You Fill It Up""
2. ""When you put the tight CAP in hot bottles. The explode will come""
3. ""Spectacular example, simply put some dry ice in an empty soda bottle, screw the cap on tightly, and stand back. As the dry ice sublimates, the bottle will fill (and then overfill) with CO2 gas. When a critical pressure is reached, the soda bottle will give out, and the makeshift pressure bomb will detonate""
4.""Boom for Gloves in the making waves 3""
    WHAT A KEY POTENTIAL FOR DOWNSIDE RISKS? AND WHEN YOU SHOULD WORRIES YOUR HOLDINGS?
    1. Trading at a historic high PER of more than 40x for the industry
2.  Implementation of wind fall tax by the government
3.  A successful development of vaccine and must official announcement by WHO
4.  A sharp decline in global daily covid-19 cases
        THIS JUNE - I WOULD LIKE TO RECALL ABOUT HARTALEGA
    Hartalega Holdings Berhad (HARTA) is an established Malaysia-based investment holding company founded by Kuan Kam Hon and is headquartered in Kuala Lumpur. HARTA is primarily involved in the business of producing latex and nitrile gloves. It has grown to be the world’s largest nitrile glove producer with the capability of manufacturing 34 billion gloves per year and with plans to progressively expand to 44.7 billion gloves in 2020.

HARTA was listed on Bursa Malaysia’s Main Market on 17 April 2008. The group has continued the technological innovations that help to ensure their gloves are manufactured with equal emphasis on efficiency and quality, a key reason why they are trusted as the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) for some of the world’s biggest brands.

The company has a workforce of 7,800 people based in 8 dedicated manufacturing facilities. It has won many prestigious accolades in both local and international front. The latest was in 2019 for Gold in Export Excellence, Exporter of The Year and The Edge Billion Ringgit Club Corporate Awards. It has also received recognition from Forbes Asia, KPMG and Asia Money.

HARTA provides a comprehensive range of products known for its superior quality and critical protection. Examples include nitrile gloves, latex gloves, surgical gloves and laboratory gloves.
As the most automated glove production company, its automated process not only improves efficiency but also eliminates product contamination resulting from human contact. HARTA produces soft stretchy nitrile gloves that emulate the properties of natural rubber latex. The nitrile gloves also eliminate the chances of protein allergy risks that are usually associated with rubber latex.

All gloves produced by HARTA are purchased by healthcare practitioners, food processing workers, lab workers and other professionals. Presently, HARTA’s export markets span across North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Africa, Russia and Middle East.

          FINANCIAL REVIEW
 
  Based on past 5 financial years’ revenue chart above, its revenue grew year-on-year (y-o-y) from FY2015 (+3.51%), FY2016 (+30.75%), FY2017 (+21.59%), FY2018 (+32.04%) to FY2019 (+17.52%). On a CAGR basis, HARTA has grown 20.62% based on 5 years. The group’s strong revenue was achieved on the back of improved sales volume which grew by 10.1% year-on-year to 28 billion pieces of gloves. The US and European Union remain key export markets accounting for 54% and 25% of their total exports respectively.
     

  HARTA has recorded a RM93.441 million increase in gross profit, translating to a growth of 15.20% from RM614.762 million in FY2018 to RM708.203 million in FY2019. Based on 5 years CAGR basis, the gross profit has grown 13.99%. The increase in gross profit for HARTA was supported by increased contribution from the United States and Europe in tandem with the growing global demand for nitrile gloves. The group was well-positioned to meet this demand growth given their continuous expansion in production capacity via their Next Generation Integrated Glove Manufacturing Complex (NGC).
       
  The Profit After Tax (PAT) of HARTA rose 3.48% from RM439.632 million in FY2018 to RM454.938 million in FY2019. On a CAGR basis, the Profit After Tax (PAT) grew by 14.29% which was in line with the growth in revenue and gross profit.

      CASH FLOW STATEMENT

The net cash from operating activities has provided a positive cash flow of RM627.399 million in FY2019 as compared to RM403.949 million in FY2018 indicating that the company is healthy and has enough cash to use for business expansion. The net cash from investing activities in FY2019 (-RM428.602 million) was mainly due to the additions to capital work-in-progress (RM398.412 million), additions to Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) (RM33.057 million) and additions to intangible assets (RM1.459 million). The negative cash flow indicates that the firm is investing in its business for growth. The net cash from financing activities in FY2019 (-RM206.644 million) was mainly due to dividend paid (RM286.177 million) and interest paid (RM10.620 million).
      COMPANY ABLE TO PAY BACK ITS LIABILITIES?

Based on liquidity ratio calculation, HARTA has a current ratio of 2.179 times in FY2019 indicating that the company does not face any liquidity issues as it is capable of paying back its liabilities (411.889 million) if any unforeseeable circumstances occur. HARTA is able to do so by using current assets such as inventories, trade & other receivables, tax assets, cash, bank balances and short-term investments amounting to RM897.442 million.
    PROSPECT AND CHALLENGES

HARTA has allocated RM630 million for Plant 6 and Plant 7 at their Next Generation integrated Glove Manufacturing Complex (NGC) in Sepang as well as RM115 million to integrate the Industry 4.0 technologies for all activities related to gloves production and manufacturing by connecting to computers for data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI).

HARTA said the NGC Plant 5 was fully commissioned during the quarter while first line of Plant 6 was expected to begin commissioning in Q1 2020 with annual installed capacity of 4.7 billion pieces. For Plant 7, which has commenced construction, would cater to small orders focusing more on specialty products with an annual installed capacity of 3.4 billion pieces. (Source: New Straits Times, 5 November 2019). According to managing director Kuan Mun Leong, the company’s annual installed capacity allows it to ramp up the output from the current 36.6 billion pieces of gloves to 44.7 billion pieces per annum by FY2022.

HARTA has launched the world’s first non-leaching antimicrobial glove (AMG) in United Kingdom.  The unprecedented innovation provides active protection against healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). The antimicrobial glove is developed in collaboration with antimicrobial Research and Development (R&D) company Chemical Intelligence UK, which has built-in antimicrobial technology proven to kill micro-organisms in order to prevent the spread of infections.
  This product is set to be available in hospitals around the world and is being produced at a lower cost in order to reduce the barriers to access. With this technology, the bacteria coming into contact will be exposed to the antimicrobial activity, which in independent testing, achieved up to a 5-log (99.999 per cent) kill rate within just 5 minutes of contact. 
      LATEST FINANCIAL RESULT
 
    INSIGHT
  In conclusion, HARTA has achieved a strong performance in FY2019 with the highest revenue, gross profit and profit after tax over the past 5 years. Its prospect remains bright as the expansion of Next Generation Integrated Glove Manufacturing Complex (NGC) is set to increase capacity from RM36.6 billion to RM44.7 billion pieces of gloves per annum by FY2022 boosted by the adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies, Internet of Things and integrated manufacturing operations. The demand growth is expected to continue particularly in the near-term given the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak across the globe.
  Also  Harta will get FDA’s approval on their antimicrobial gloves soon. Would be a big catalyst to fly.Kuan says he is expecting US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for the antimicrobial glove soon.
  “We just started selling to about 20 countries now and the quantity is not yet significant and is very small. We will see a pick-up after we get the FDA certification. The FDA certification is key and we are targeting for it within the next one year. This is our target,” he says.
        WHY IT MUST CONTINUE RALLY UP THIS JUNE?
 
1. Global demand - Rubber gloves sector to see upsides from surging world demand.
 
-  We maintained overweight on the rubber gloves sector with expectations of surging demand from the US due to the trade-war effect. Since Sept 1, a 15% tariff has been imposed on Chinese-made medical and vinyl gloves, which should increase their pricing versus local rubber gloves.
- We also expects the positive impact to be felt from the final quarter of the year as US gloves demand switches to local glove players, where the US accounts for 28% to 55% of glove players' group sales.
    2. Glove Shortage - From oversupply to shortage due to pandemic and MCO & CMCO
 
- It was only last year when there were repeated concerns of an oversupply in the rubber glove industry that hogged the headlines. But the situation has completely changed today in just a span of just a few months into the year 2020 with talk of an oversupply in the rubber glove industry being firmly a thing of the past.
 
- The Covid-19 outbreak which is now categorised as a global pandemic has upended everything and there are now concerns of undersupply in the rubber glove industry at this very crucial time.
    3. Exchange Rate USD/MYR For Export. ( Ringgit  Loser Still)
 
- Export-based companies: Glove makers such as Top Glove Corp Bhd and Supermax Corp Bhd - who rake in US dollar-denominated revenues, will likely see an erosion in margins this year due to the stronger ringgit, unless they can pass on the additional costs to consumers. The Manufacturer's selling price of gloves had increased from USD 25 to USD 110, an increase of 340%.
    4. Low Crude Oil Prices are Still.
 
- Rubber glove shares wil rise when oil prices fall actually. Rubber glove also on attention while oil prices crashing. Rubber will get cheaper to make as the price of crude oil drops. Production costs will be low.
 
5. No vaccine for COVID-19 yet.
 
- According to WHO. Vaccine for new coronavirus 'COVID-19' could be ready in 18
months. The first vaccine targeting China’s coronavirus could be available in 18
months, so we have to do everything today using available weapons. For official its a MUST announcement by WHO.
    Good luck and stay tuned! #staysafe #stayhome

It's a bubble. A feeding frenzy. An impending catastrophe.
  In half-open coffeeshops all over the country, it's what everybody's talking about. A seemingly never-ending love for gloves, and any stock with a whiff of healthcare in them.
  Suddenly, everybody's opening trading accounts. Everyone wants to try the trading gig, because easy money is here, and if we were to gauge the general sentiment, easy money is here to stay.
  I kept hearing all sorts of anecdotal stories. A man throws his life savings into buying SUPERMX warrants. A banker gets distracted all the time during her meetings because she had to check the steady ticks of TOPGLOV stock in her mobile trading app.
  And my personal favorite : a WFH friend in the oil and gas industry who goes on Zoom calls for a high-powered business meeting, with his four trading monitors just out of sight on his live video feed.
  He has a soft spot for a low-tier glovemaker trading at 100 times earnings. I have a soft spot for calling him a dumbass.
  Still, by luck or skill, this historic rally has minted some crazy rich Asians. One estimate pegs the total wealth creation caused by the increase in glove stocks at RM70 billion.
  Source : NagaWarrants Telegram
  I have my own story. I wouldn't exactly say I came of age as a trader in this MCO/gloves market mania, but I have made enough from the rally to talk about this subject with some measure of conviction.
  But funnily enough, I don't have much of a technicals viewpoint to offer here because the fundamentals perspective is far more interesting. I believe this hasn't been talked about enough, and it's time that we really pay attention to the numbers. 
  So for a moment, let's cease the hyperbole. I'll try to cut through the bullshit for you. 
  But why should you listen to me? Because I'll be honest : every day I vacillate between two completely opposite viewpoints: 'this fucking gloves rally is the biggest bubble since Dutch tulips' and 'this fucking gloves rally is a profit opportunity of a lifetime'.
  I'm uncertain. I'm indecisive, for sure.
  But here's the thing: it does not hinder my trading. I have already made profits in both huge rallies and in precipitous collapses in the sector. As a team, we have traded the sector far before the age of Covid (BC), and during. Mother share, warrants, all of them. All kinds.
  Just some selections. Some are my personal victories, some are that of our team members. We are on the lookout for more opportunities like these.
    Our cumulative gains in selected glove stocks, February to June 2020
    I have been obsessing over this gloves sector story for a while. Having read a truckload of research reports and their fantastical findings over the past few months, my first gut reaction was to be totally incredulous.
    I was dismissive, although as per the norm, the negative attitude comes from a place of anti-learning. I just needed to take the time and think of the situation.
  In truth, I couldn't make up my mind. Either it's a bust or a boom of a generation. Reading the financial news does not help in the slightest.
  I have studied market manias. I have traded a few of them. But this is new to me.
  My thinking about market manias can be summed up as follows:
  Speculative manias fizzle out when the fundamentals (or lack thereof) catch up to lofty expectations.
  But what was perceived to be speculative manias can suddenly turn into a legitimate value proposition if the fundamentals are actually supportive of the lofty expectations.
  So is there such a thing as a fundamentals-driven mania?
  As I've said, I'm trying to cut through the bullshit and hyperbole. To do this, I had to forcibly let go of all perceived biases.
  In other words, I'm giving this mania a chance to make sense.
  IT IS WHAT IT IS : A COMMODITY
      Let's go back in time for an imperfect, but useful, historical analogue.
  In 1973, the Organisation of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC) declared an oil embargo on the United States for its support of Israel during the Yom Kippur War. 
  This was economic weaponisation. OAPEC effectively introduced a supply shock into the world by cutting off US access to its oil. There was not much in the way of substitutes at the time. As the dominant oil supplier, the Arabs get to throw their weight around.
  The effect? Miles and miles of long lines at US gas stations. Oil prices shot up 400% in six months (this was back when they were trading at the single-digit per barrel range).
  So why is the comparison to the oil embargo that happened 47 years ago appropriate to what is happening now?
    It's because gloves are a commodity. And commodities respond to supply-demand dynamics. 
  Covid-19 has triggered a demand shock for gloves on a truly global scale, the kind of which will be talked about... well, 47 years from now.
  Maybank IB report on TOPGLOV, 29 May 2020
  Prices are shooting up, and by all accounts, demand for gloves has exploded exponentially.
  Economics 101 applies here. Supply rises to catch up with demand. Eventually you will have equilibrum, and then we get more supply than demand. Prices go down. 
  That commodity's selling price determines the seller's margins and ultimately profitability. Basic stuff. 
  We know that supply and demand dynamics are cyclical. So should we scream 'bubble' every time we are in an upcycle?
  The gloves sector is merely at the beginning of this phase, and there is a considerable amount of time until the dynamic balances itself. You can plausibly invest in the sector and exit with massive double digit gains within two years. That would be a big score.
  But the really big score actually lies in the Big 4 - TOPGLOV, KOSSAN, HARTA, and SUPERMX. As a collective, they have enough scale, and enough of a protective moat, to dominate the bulk of future revenues in this sector over the next two years.
  Even with current valuations, these are the stocks going up that can stay up. Because the fundamental justification for it is there.
  Why specifically two years? It's because (no) thanks to Covid-19, tens of billions (of pieces) in future gloves demand has been brought forward into the present, today. Most of this year, and next year, is where we will see the bumper earnings.
  If you can plausibly time the upcycle, would you invest in the relevant companies? At what point does the mania gets reclassified as an upcyle?
    When in doubt, always go back to the fundamentals.
    THE 100 TIMES EARNINGS PROBLEM
    Maybank IB report on TOPGLOV, 29 May 2020.TP:RM20.
  We become truly uncomfortable when a game-changer catalyst upends our established world views, none more so in the subject of stock price valuations.
  When prices get ahead of our expectations, and our perception of how much certain stocks should be worth, we tend to retreat into dogma. The typical way to cling on to our own set of values is to denounce, reject, and ridicule all contrary views. 
  So let's entertain some of these farfetched notions related to glove counters right now.
  Why would you buy a stock that currently trades at 50-100 times their historical earnings multiples?
  The headline figures are as described: it's historical. If the world's largest glovemakers - already insanely profitable in normal times - are expected to double their annual profits due to the demand shock, those uncomfortable P/Es would undoubtedly come down. The 'E' catches up with the lofty 'P'.
  I don't understand the loopy logic that one can only invest in a stock once the P/E comes down. By this time you would have totally missed out on the price gains, but you still say that's the point where people can come in and invest?
  In effect, this explains the seemingly insane (at first glance) target prices for TOPGLOV by Credit Suisse (RM23) and Maybank (RM20), but they are not insane.
  Their respective analysts simply imputed future earnings potential into their target prices. And when earnings catch up with the price, the P/E would come down to... well, merely the historical averages for the sector. About 30 times earnings, to be specific.
  Again, it's not exactly fairytale stuff. In a world where all major glovemakers are expected to nearly double their earnings, the 'P' would be more than justified at current levels. And as you may have seen from recent target price upgrades for the Big 4, there's some ways to go.
  What we have a two-year hypergrowth situation. Or to put it another way, glovemakers are currently  fetching valuations normally reserved for tech companies, most of which will continue to trade at 50 times P/Es for the next 20 years (like dangling a carrot in front of a treadmill... you can chase but you'll never get it).
  Another example. IHH Healthcare Bhd rather famously traded at 50 times earnings for more than half a decade since listing. One explanation is that investors are clearly convinced of its growth prospects, and thus bought into the stock at current levels in anticipation of future earnings catching up.
  So is anyone calling it out for being a bubble?
  IHH Healthcare Bhd financial summary. CIMB Report, March 24 2020
    My point is : why should glovemakers treated any differently? They didn't trigger their own ridiculous price rallies. Supply and demand dynamics did.
  How about the argument that retail investors are the only ones nutty enough to chase SUPERMX at RM8, when it was trading at RM1.70 in February?
  Our industry sources tell us that even in recent weeks, investment banks are still holding regular conference calls with institutional investors and fund managers to discuss... glove stocks as a buying opportunity. 
  These folks, with their billions of dollars in deployable cash, can only invest in the Big 4, because these are the only counters big enough to accumulate in size, and big enough to make their money work for them.
  Chasing is still chasing, whether you're a retail day trader with a cash upfront account or a billion-dollar international hedge fund. That target of that chase is yields.
  The world is in the midst of a painful recession. There is intensifying demand for (bubble-proof) stocks that can deliver on the scarcity premium : the fortunate ones who would deliver world-beating returns in a Covid-19-driven downturn.
  Malaysia contribute nearly two thirds of the world's global gloves sales. The world is desperate to get ahold of them.
  The Big 4 are offering yield opportunities quite unlike any other non-healthcare stock in the world right now.
    Why shouldn't investors be desperate to get ahold of glove stocks?
  The Big 4's performance in May 2020 up to the early days of June
  HOW ABOUT THE OTHERS?
  Let's talk a bit about the alternative choices.
  My preference for the Big 4, instead of the second tier players like COMFORT, RUBEREX, and CAREPLS, comes down to several factors.
  1) The investor base is primarily retail driven, hence they are much more vulnerable to sharp price swings.
  2) There has been tremendous hype and chatter over these counters when they were 100% up in April. After another 100%+ increase in the stock prices, that chatter has not just died down, it has in fact intensified.
  3) Their profit growth prospects are admittedly tremendous, but mainly due to the fact that all of them are starting from a very low base. They are nowhere near in terms of the Big 4's sheer scale of operations.
      There are other risks inherent in the second-tier players, namely that if they command 100 times earnings multiples right now, it is less certain that their earnings growth will bring back those P/Es to more reasonable levels.
  Some have just established new production lines. Some have just raised cash. Some have just begun being hyped by rich uncles. Emphasis on 'just', because in the game of gloves, timing is everything.
  From a purely economies of scale basis, the second tier players will always be second best to the Big 4. They will always be playing catch up. Their overall production volumes will remain tiny, compared to say, what HARTA alone produces in any given month.
  Making gloves is not that hard, but there are certain nuances in the business that will get the dominant players farther ahead.The little things do add up.
  The Big 4 specifically possesses inherent advantages that will ensure the bulk of the business (glove orders) flow to them. It's a kind of protective moat that I would put a premium on.
  What are they? Let me take a deep breath here...
  You need really solid QCs. You can't run afoul of the US FDA standards, otherwise you'll end up with 100 containers of unusable gloves. You need an established global sales network. You should ideally have loyal and repeat customers who have kept coming back. You need to be experienced and credible enough to have done direct negotiations with foreign governments and their health ministries. You simply cannot deliver a batch of shoddy gloves when frontliners around the world need them to protect their lives. Your history of success supplements your reputation. Trust, quality of product, and delivery, are not expected to be an issue.
  I don't mean to knock off the non-Big 4 names. It's just that their share of the spoils, even on a cumulative basis, will be much smaller compared to say, what SUPERMX will be getting in the coming years.
  The overheating and speculative elements are far more acute in the non-Big 4 healthcare stocks, because there is slightly less assurance that their bumper earnings will materialise as hoped.
   This is NOT an issue for the big fellas.
  FUTURE GLOVE MONEY, TODAY
  Another piece of the puzzle : how do we account for these future sales and ensure that they actually translate to real orders, and real earnings?
  Two words : spot orders. 
  The Big 4's protective moat is evidenced by the customers' intent to acquire their product, no matter the price. Customers know that these guys can deliver; they just need to pay up.
  For the first time, glovemakers have real leeway to adjust pricing, in a business that is notoriously thin in margins. Average selling prices are shooting up, again justified by the demand shock.
  In a real demonstration of the extent of this demand shock, the sellers are dictating not only the prices, but also the terms. 
  To lock in their orders, customers are now required to pay advance deposits.
  In other words, the Big 4 are actualising part of future sales, today. In real money. That earnings bump is assured.
  Based on one estimate, spot prices have gone up from $25 in pre-Covid times to $100 presently. That's a 300% increase. Exponential.
  TOPGLOV sales orders and spot prices, from Credit Suisse's report on 3 June 2020. TP: RM23.
    Lead times have quadrupled. Instead of 35-40 days to wait for your bulk order, it now takes up to a year!
  40 days to 365? That's an 800% increase. Exponential.
  TOPGLOV has an annual production capacity of 78.7 billion pieces, from 700 production lines. And you say that their backlog runs up to a whole year?
  Or how about new orders doubling within months? 100% growth, you say?
  And of course, the Big 4 have the capacity to take the billions in additional orders, and even then the demand shock does not let up.
   SUPERMX order book increase, from CGS-CIMB's report on June 2 2020. TP: RM9.80
   Net profits can rise 79% within a year and it would still be cheap relative to the sector average?
  From the same CGS-CIMB report
  As a trader, I'm not dogmatic in my views. I get things wrong every single day.
  But pervasive skepticism - in the face of actual, solid fundamentals - could be a big buy signal. The real question is : what price are you willing to pay for exponential growth?
  I would be slightly more surprised if a stock like say, SUPERMX, collapses to RM2 at any point over the next two years. Less surprised if it hits RM11.50, for the reasons described above.
  My personal view : the biggest profit opportunities are in companies that you can both trade and invest in.
  The fundamental justification is there. I'm neither worried nor confused. You shouldn't be, too.

  This article is going to be hugely unpopular. But let me put it, I am a supporter of Malaysian gloves business, you can do a search on my write-ups. The recent events on increasing valuation for gloves not just by retail investors but analysts' recommendations really surprised me. Let me take the largest of the gloves maker - Top Glove which is the largest maker by far. I have no doubt that the demand-supply had gone out of whack. However, how is it that the valuation can be this high.

Two analysts put it at around RM20, another put it at RM23. Today, Top Glove's price is around RM15.60. That translates to RM52.6 billion, RM60.5 billion and RM41 billion valuation respectively. Numbers are just numbers. I am taking those numbers and try to present where it is based on that valuation and what are the risks by picking those prices, especially at RM23 and RM20.

Below are the most aggressive numbers based on a RM23 valuation. The analyst presented the numbers for the subsequent 3 years between 2020 to 2023 and went silent on numbers further down the road. It is obvious the next 2 years will be period where numbers are going to be very high - I do not dispute. I am thinking even at 2022/23 (PAT RM836.6 million), if the profits is going to double the numbers for the normal period of 2019/20 - that is a stretch.


However, let us just say I am going to be hugely bullish i.e. after the period 2022/23, it will still grow at 10% per year for the next 6 years. Based on the above situation, I have put up 3 situations i.e. at what average PE would the company be given their price of RM23, RM20 and RM15.60. The average PEs for 10 years would be very high indeed - 64x (at RM23), 55.5x (RM20) and 43.3x (RM15.60)

To go for a more humble situation, I would not challenge the numbers for the next 3 years but let us put the 2023/24 PAT at a more realistic number. Post 2023, the PAT will drop by 20% - even then its number would be 84% higher from its normal year i.e. 2019/20. Subsequently, the profit numbers would grow 5%. That translates to 80.51x PE for price of RM23, 70x PE (RM20) and even a very high 54.61x PE for its current price of RM15.60.


Even, at a price of RM10 (which is not something we can expect given it is now RM15.60, the average PE would have been 35x, given the scenario above. See below's table. That is still high.


Now, let's look at the economics of rubber gloves.

Remember, rubber gloves while at today's situation it is difficult to create enough supply to meet demand, however are we saying that the demand-supply will still be abnormal after COVID-19. In fact, with the creation of extra capacity at large quantities, it is possible that there could be oversupply situation by then i.e. 3 years after this pandemic started in Jan 20.

Rubber gloves business is not a monopolistic business, although there are situations where certain companies such as Top Glove, Kossan and Hartalega are the larger of the manufacturers. Are we saying that with COVID-19 assuming to be still around after this 2 years, there will not be ramp up of supplies by these guys who would act as check and balance of each other in terms of competition? What about the other players?

How long does it take to create new factories and new lines? More than a year?

I cannot see the economics of it as this business is not in a situation where barriers of entry is very high. No player has huge advantage over the other except for some extra efficiencies and economies of scale. Given the huge margins today, many new companies will not even bother with scale. There could even be new entrants - have any of the analysts thought of this given it is so lucrative?

There are just too much unknowns and many of these are not put into considerations. For many businesses, by putting a overly high price, they run into risks of being shun when situation becomes normal. Typically for this business, it is about long term relationships. I understand that some of them had created a new idea by putting a percentage of their supplies on the spot market (meaning let it be done through bids). However, business like this is not done in such manner. It is not our typical commodities.

Also, ahead of Top Glove’s earnings results scheduled to be released next week, MQ Research expects a better-than-expected 3QFY20 and an even stronger 4Q20.
Conclusion
MQ Research reiterates an Outperform rating on Top Glove with an increased target price of RM20.50 based on a higher CY21 price-to-earnings (PE) ratio of 40x vs RM12.30 on a 32x PE before. The strong pricing power and lower customer concentration risk provide Top Glove more flexibility to raise the average selling price (ASP), and now the company is looking to increase guidance, indicating upside risk to consensus estimates. As MQ Research views gloves as a staple within the medical sector, MQ Research thinks the valuation is undemanding and looks more attractive than consumer staples, which trade at a >40x PE with lower earnings growth of ~10% vs Top Glove: 27%.
Impact
New and more aggressive ASP strategy. Shortages have led to stronger pricing power for glove manufacturers. Based on MQ Research’s checks, Top Glove increased its June and July order deliveries higher than initial guidance of 5% per month. In addition, Top Glove implemented a new capacity allocation strategy for the remainder of 2020 – 10% for spot orders, which has at least a 2.5x-3x higher ASP, and increased its exposure to smaller distributors, which allows more upside risk to the ASP in this period. As such, MQ Research raises its FY20E-21E ASP assumption by 10-15%.
Expect good 3QFY20 results but 4QFY20 to be stronger. 3QFY20 results will start reflecting the COVID-19 orders and the total ASP increase of 10%-15% in March-May order deliveries. However, MQ Research expects 4QFY20 will be even stronger on the back of the more aggressive ASP increases and its new capacity allocation strategy. MQ Research expects the 2HFY20 earnings before interest tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) margin will be expanded to 33%, the highest since its listing. MQ Research’s 2HFY20 implies a quadruple in net profit vs 1HFY20 (Fig1).
Multiple re-rating due to strong quarterly earnings. History has shown that Top Glove’s share price tracks quarterly earnings. MQ Research believes the next re-rating catalyst is strong 4QFY20-3QFY21 quarterly earnings. The stock is likely to re-test its peak PER valuation of 40x.

The following is a small excerpt of the 5 pages article by Credit Suisse on Top Glove with a target price of Rm 23.00.
The above is the Top Glove price chart. At first, I thought it was not realistic because about 6 weeks ago, it was only around Rm 6.50 and the last traded price was Rm 15.44. But after I studied the report carefully, I believe the target price of Rm 23 is achievable because the company can sell gloves at 3-4 times the normal price to customers who requires the gloves urgently. It is called spot price or cash on delivery.  
The normal margin of profit is only about 20-30% of the sale revenue. If the company can double its revenue, its profit will be phenomenal. The complete additional revenue becomes profit.
The last traded price was Rm 15.44. If the target price of Rm 23.00 is achievable, it will surely lift up all the other glove shares such as Comfort and Supermax. That is why I named the title of this article “A rising tide lifts all boats”.

KUALA LUMPUR (June 4): Credit Suisse has raised its target price for Top Glove Corp Bhd to RM23, more than double of RM11.30 previosly, on the ground that there has been a recent rise in ad hoc and spot orders by government agencies needing urgent deliveries.
In a note dated June 3, Credit Suisse analyst Joanna Cheah said while pricing was not locked in upfront for these volumes, the group took deposits between 10% and  30%, based on projected average selling price (ASP) increases depending on the expected month of delivery and thus, Top Glove had decided to allocate 10% of its capacity for these spot orders.
""Given the long lead time for normal orders, it is therefore no surprise that ASP for the ad hoc spot orders is much higher. 
""According to management, some of these orders were priced above US$100 per 1000 pieces, which is more than three times higher than the current blended ASP for the normal orders,"" Cheah said. 
In addition, while the company was previously guiding for 5%-10% increases in ASP every quarter, given the further squeeze in demand-supply for gloves, it was now guiding for a monthly double-digit ASP increase at least for the next two months.
""Given the revised strategy and ASP guidance by the company, we have raised our FY20 (financial year 2020)-FY22 earnings per share by 20%-135%. We now expect the group's earnings to grow 182% in FY20, a further 122% in FY21 but decline by 63% in FY22 as ASP normalises.
""Our earnings forecast assumes that ASP will rise by 20% in FY21 for both nitrile and powder-free gloves, and decline by 20% in FY22,"" she said.
She added that Top Glove's results for the third quarter of FY20 set to be released on June 11 are expected to be strong and should drive further rerating of the stock.
""One of the key concerns has been the risk of oversupply as the rubber glove players embark on expansion and demand settles post the pandemic. Looking at the current planned supply by the top five major players (including Sri Trang), we think there will be a squeeze in demand-supply for the next two years,"" she said.
Just yesterday, the price-earnings valuation of Hartalega, Top Glove and Rubberex breached the 100 times mark, which is rarely seen among manufacturing-oriented companies.
She noted the current demand is estimated to be 50%-60% higher if not for capacity constraints resulting in long lead time.
Meanwhile, estimated supply is expected to grow by 9% cumulatively between now and end-2020 and another 12% by end-2021.
At the midday break today, Top Glove rose 1.49% or 22 sen to RM14.92, valuing it at RM39.25 billion.

Industry shortage has led to uptrend in pricing.
Raise Top Glove's net profit forecasts on higher ASP assumptions.
BUY with higher Target Price of RM18.45 on strong earnings growth.
Stronger Product Pricing on Shortage
The robust demand for gloves is leading to industry shortage and average selling price (ASP) increases. We understand that utilisation rate is running at more than 90% and order backlog has extended to one year. We raise our FY20-22F net profit forecasts for Top Glove by 96-133% to factor in higher product price assumptions.
We expect the higher ASPs to be reflected in sequentially stronger 3QFY20 profit. 2H20 should see a significant step up in sales volume and margins compared to 1H20.
Upgrade Top Glove to BUY in view of the strong earnings outlook.
Uptrend in ASP Expectations
We gather ASP increased about 5%-10% m-o-m in March-May and about 15% in June-July due to strong demand. Currently, the market is facing a shortage of gloves due to COVID-19 and order backlog has increased from four months to one year.
Overall, ASP in 2HFY20 is expected to be higher than 1HFY20. With the anticipation of a continuous increase in ASP, we have adjusted our FY20 ASP growth assumption upwards to 11% y-o-y.
Profit margin is expected to be better at 16.6% for FY20 compared to 7.9% in FY19 and 9.3% in 1HFY20 on the back of strong volume growth and higher ASPs.
Our net profit assumption for FY20-FY22F is adjusted upwards by 96%, 133% and 129% respectively as we factor in higher product price assumptions.
BUY With Higher Target Price of RM18.45
We raise our target price to RM18.45, based on PE of 39x CY21F earnings. This is based on +2 SD of its 5-year mean. TOPG is trading at 33x forward PE or close to +1.3 SD of its 5-year mean PE.
Upgrade Top Glove from HOLD to BUY in view of its strong earnings outlook.
Where We Differ
Our FY20/21F net profit forecasts are 32%/28% higher than consensus as we have factored in higher sales volume and ASP due to the robust demand arising from the COVID-19 outbreak.
Potential Catalysts
Stronger-than-expected ASP and sales volume will further drive the company’s earnings and share price. Every 1% improvement in net margin could boost TOPG’s net profit by 7.4%. A second wave of COVID-19 infections after the gradual easing of lockdowns could see glove demand sustained at high levels.
In the long term, even as infection rates ease, we expect COVID-19 to drive increased usage of gloves globally, sustaining a “new normal” of demand.

继马银行和兴业投行之后，大马投行、联昌研究与大华继显，周三也加入对手套股按金户头设限行列。其中，大华继显扩大对加护手套（CAREPLS,0163,创业板医疗保健组）和稳大（ADVENTA,7191,主板医疗保健组）设限，且超过10万令吉手套股交易一律付现。
来百利 速柏玛 康复手套跌停
手套股周三盘中再深跌，其中早前涨势迅猛的速柏玛（SUPERMX,7106,主板医疗保健组）与康复手套（COMFORT,2127,主板工业产品服务组）盘中接近跌停板，而来百利机构（RUBEREX,7803,主板工业产品服务组）一度跌停。
顶级手套（TOPGLOV,7113,主板医疗保健组）盘中最低报10令吉58仙，下跌28.5%或4令吉22仙。
贺特佳（HARTA,5168,主板医疗保健组）盘中最低报9令吉40仙，下跌26.2%或3令吉34仙。
高产柅品（KOSSAN,7153,主板医疗保健组）最低一度跌21.93%或1令吉93仙，报6令吉87仙。
速柏玛最低跌29.96%或2令吉28仙，报5令吉33仙。
至于二三线手套股康复手套最低跌1令吉12仙或29.86%，至2令吉63仙。
来百利机构最低跌1令吉14仙或30%，至2令吉66仙。
尽管如此，大马投行与各行认为手套原料价低、需求高、高价格强化赚幅，建议“加码”手套股。
分析员指出，手套公司预期需求可增长30至50%（疫情前为8%至10%）；高需求也导致供应短缺，尤其使医疗手套平均售价升高。
根据手套商指出，平均售价按季增长5至15%，过去数月在严缺货的惊慌抢购中甚至暴涨100至400%。
分析员调高手套平均价格2至9%，相信2021年售价将继续增长，因为冠病疫苗大约需12至18个月才能面市。
该行预料马币兑美元今年报4.29，2021年挂4.25，预期马币走强将进一步扩大手套公司赚幅。在供应紧缺时，成本节省无需回扣客户。
大马投行指出，疫情后的新常态，人均手套使用也将增加，这不仅发生在医疗领域，餐饮和其他领域也一样。
早前，在新兴国如中国与印度人均使用介于2至6个手套，相比先进国100至280个。
该行维持顶级手套“买进”评级，目标价从12令吉23仙提高至17令吉38仙。调高顶级手套2020至2022财政年财测21%、71%及33%，预期净赚幅更高，分别为增加2至14.7%，增4.5至16%和升2.5至11%。
大马投行预期疫情后手套需求可持续一年，因此预测顶级手套2021财政年平均售价增2%至29美元，2022财政年预测售价24美元。
该行上修高产柅品2020至2022财政年财测10%、14%和25%，建议买进，目标价从9令吉72仙调高至11令吉零5仙。
马银行研究指出，手套平均售价可能增长50%，不过管理层不愿披露时限。
该行调高贺特佳至“持有”，目标价从7令吉37仙调高至12令吉43仙。调高2021至2023年财测（财政年3月杪截止）41%、47%与18%。
风险管理
长远有利
投行研究主管涂慧翎认为，这项为按金户头的交易设限是风险管理措施，无可厚非。
“特别是一些手套股股价，在很短期内大幅飙涨，风险管理有其必要。”
著名投资界人士官有缘认为，手套股近日大幅飙涨，涨久必跌是必然趋势，这也可能与一些投行对按金交易设限有关。
涂慧翎指出，投行有本身的标准作业程序需要遵循，为按金户头设限是风险管理措施，并不意味一些投行背后有操纵行动。
黄氏发展证券高级抽佣经纪卢文豪也认为，这项措施既保护股票行财务，也保障客户利益和减低风险，对马股长远表现也比较有利。
他表示，某个主题股过热、波动大总会有风险，截至昨日（周二）他未接获该行跟进上述措施的指示。
提到这项设限，会否把焦点转移至上述母股的凭单，他表示，买卖凭单有截止期限；除非很有时间持续监控起落，不然风险偏高。
Mercury证券分析员胡文耀认为，手套股最近热呼呼，投行设上述限制是良好风险管理，他认为手套需求可持续至明年，料这不阻碍手套股璀璨前景。

根据CLSA的报告，手套仍然有29-48% 的上浮的空间。
由于Covid-19，手套生产商的表现已超越年初至今，其累计市值飙升了109％。虽然我们最近提高了盈利预测，但进一步检查市场平均售价趋势和行业同业最近的盈利结果表明，股价势头似乎还远没有结束。
我们在这份报告中进一步作出盈利和目标价的调整：

Target Price
Topglov从RM 11.11上调至RM 14.70
Harta 从RM 10.60上调至RM 12.60
Kossan 从RM 9.20 上调至RM 9.80

提高手套的平均售价 (Average Selling Price) 是真的。

1) 我们的基本假设是，在有2020年订单的情况下，平均售价将在2020年上升。对于大多数手套制造商来说，运行时间从两个月的时间延长到现在的9-12个月。
2) 实地检查以及行业同行最近发布的收益。目前手套的售价是  USD 100 / 1000pcs
  3) Top Glove（FYE-Aug）和Kossan（FYE-Dec）的FY20CL收入增长预测分别提高了32％和10％，并将Hartalega的FY21CL（3月）收入提高了18％。
      为何ASP 那么高，但是Harta Kossan 的最新业绩不会暴涨？
之前的季度报告记录 Jan  - Mar 2020， 之前的平均售价在交付前的两个月内就被锁定了
Feb & Mar 2020突然暴涨的需求量会在五月才交货。因此预计下个季度将会呈现很好的成绩。
  那么几时才要离开手套呢？就是当疫苗成功研制的时候。
疫苗最早需要12-18个月
疫苗最早从生产到全球上市都需要12到18个月的时间。实际上，疫苗开发最早可能会在2021年中期进行，但要注意的是一切进展顺利。我们假设到2021年中期开发疫苗，那么意味着手套公司继续赚取更多的盈利。


Margin Share Capping调低手套的capping  ?
众多的银行都有issue warrant 跟投资者对赌，如果你详细留意，绝大部分的Exercise Price 都比起妈妈股来得更加低。这也意味着当妈妈股上得更高，那么银行将会亏损很多？

如果要亏少，那么可以怎样做呢？就是要妈妈股他们知道很多投资者有用margin投资手套业。最简单的方式就是调低手套的Margin 估值. 当手套估值下跌，那么投资者的Margin就会很容易超支，因此他们被逼变卖部分手套以避免中Margin Call. 这个就是最主要的原因 。
对我而言，这些都是他们的阴谋论～别再被骗了，过后他们又会说手套很好了

Due to Covid 19 pandemic the demand for medical gloves far exceeded supply. As a result, glove price has been going up higher and higher and all glove manufacturers are making more and more profit which are being reflected on their share prices.
As you can see all the glove makers’ share prices have gone up more than 400% within 6 weeks. No stock can go up or drop continuously for whatever reasons. After sometime it will change its moving trend. In the case of glove share, all of them are dropping today which is a healthy sign.
Another reason for the price correction is that a few investment banks have started price capping for glove shares for safety of the bank and also their clients who are using margin finance. For example, RHB capped 35% for all glove shares and the clients are given 30 days to regularise their margin accounts.
A few days ago, I posted my article about RHB’s real intention for its downgraded Comfort from buy to neutral. I criticised its real intention. Today RHB published a buy recommendation for Supermax with Rm 10.50 as its target price. RHB might have bought enough of Supermax and are buying Comfort.   
All investment banks have many different kinds of shares in their portfolios. Almost all their holdings are being dampened by the Covid 19 pandemic and their have to sell to cut loss. Currently, they are all cash rich and they are buying glove shares aggressively. That is why the daily traded volumes are unprecedented. The average daily traded volume for Comfort is more that 80 million shares. Very often the volume exceeds 100 million shares. Only investment banks have so much money to buy so aggressively.
My old friend Mr Ooi Teik Bee is a very reliable and famous fund manager. He circulates his weekly share analysis report to his 1,000 subscribers. His yearly subscription fee is Rm 1,000. If you are interested you can contact him 01112813880 or email: tbooifx@gmail.com.   
He has given his permission for me to excerpt his calculation for Comfort, Supermax and Top Glove as follows:
Comfort
Comfort produces 5.4*1.12 = 6.048 Billion rubber gloves a year. 85% is Nitrile gloves, 15% is Latex gloves. Comfort produces 5.14 billion Nitrile gloves a year (85%)
  Assume the selling price of Nitrile glove at USD 0.03 per piece or RM 0.126
Total revenue of Nitrile gloves  = 5.14 billion*RM 0.126 = 647.64 million
  Comfort produces 907.20 million Latex gloves a year (15%)
Assume the selling price of latex glove at USD 0.02 per piece or RM 0.084
Total revenue of latex gloves  = 907.20 million*RM 0.084 = 76.20 million
  Grand total revenue = 647.64+76.20 =723.84 million 
  At 30% margin, PBT = 217.15 million  
Assume 20% tax, PAT = 173.72 million 
  NOS = 583 million 
EPS = 173.72/583 = 0.30 
  If PER = 20, the target price = 5.96. 
If PER = 26, the target price = 7.75.
  Supermx 
Supermx produces 26 billion rubber gloves  a year. 63% is Nitrile gloves, the balance 37% is latex or other gloves. Supermx produces 16.38 billion Nitrile gloves a year (63%)
  Assume the selling price of Nitrile glove at USD 0.03 per piece or RM 0.126
Total revenue = 16.38 billion*RM 0.126 = 2.063 billion.
  Supermx produces 9.62 billion Latex gloves a year (37%).
Assume the selling price of latex glove at USD 0.02 per piece or RM 0.084
Total revenue = 906.75 million*RM 0.084 = 808.08 million
  Grand total revenue = 2.063 billion + 808.08 million = 2.871.96 billion
At 30% margin, PBT = 861.59 million 
  Assume 20% tax, PAT = 689.27 million
NOS = 1,360 million 
EPS = 689.27/1360 =  0.51 
  If PER = 20, the target price = 10.14.
If PER = 26, the target price = 13.18.
  Topglov
Both Maybank and Macquarie give a target price of RM 20.00 for Topglov for FY 2021. Topglov listed in SGX closed at SGD 6.35 today. Assuming 1 SGD = RM 3.07,  Topglov listed in SGX closed at RM 19.50 today.  
  I believe the target price of Topglov listed in KLSE at RM 20.00 is achievable. The reasons I revised up the target price
The price increase example is obtained from Supermx's analyst briefing note.
Before COVID-19, the price of gloves was USD 90, and the selling price of OEM was about USD 25.  
The profit margin of the manufacturer is about 9%-13%.
Today, the price of gloves has reached USD 150, of which the manufacturer's Selling Price increased to USD 110.
The distributor's Mark-Up Price has decreased.
The Manufacturer's selling price of gloves had increased from USD 25 to USD 110, an increase of 340%.  
  My recommendation
I set the target price of Comfort ranging from 5.96 to 8.95. The minimum target price is at 5.96.
If you buy Comfort at 4.20, the potential gain is 42%.
I set the target price of Supermx ranging from 10.14 to 13.18. The minimum target price is at 10.14.
If you buy Supermx at 7.95, the potential gain is 28%.  
I set the target price of Topglov at 20.00.
If you buy Topglov at 15.54, the potential gain is 29%.

We highlight that TOPGLOV’s ASP for months of June to Aug is now higher by between 5% to 15%, as opposed to earlier guidance of +5%. With a diverse customer base, we expect TOPLGOV to have better pricing power and hence potentially higher-than-expected industry average prices. Hence, we raised our FY20E/FY21E net profit by 18%/28%, to account for higher ASPs. TP is raised from RM15.60 to RM20.10 based on unchanged 36x CY21E revised EPS. Reiterate Outperform.
ASPs higher than earlier guidance. We highlight that TOPGLOV’s ASP for months of June to Aug is now higher by between 5% to 15%, as opposed to earlier guidance of +5%, indicating supply tightness have further propelled ASP higher. However, spot price is about 3x the normal prices of USD28-30/1000 pieces which accounts for 5%-10% of total allocation. With a diverse customer base, we expect TOPLGOV to have better pricing power and hence potentially higher-than-expected industry average prices. We highlight that market consensus is still underappreciating the potential impact from higher-than-expected ASPs in this continuing pandemic and tight supply condition. Due to the tight supply, we expect buyers to jockey for position in order to secure allocation which will push up ASPs. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) of which glove is one of the components is presently much sought after due to limited supply. Longer delivery lead times are indicating that demand will outstrip supply at least over the medium-term. Management highlighted that requests for huge volumes of gloves to the tune of 400m to 500m pieces are coming from countries that include Spain, France, Italy, Germany, and Saudi Arabia. This lends us the confidence that mid to high-teens growth in volume sales are achievable in FY20 and FY21 since orders have been secured up till end Dec 2020 to early 2021. The robust demand has led to longer delivery lead times which has risen to >300 days from 80 to 100 days two months ago.
Capacity expansion include: Factory 7A (operational by end-1Q 2020; 0.4bn pieces), Factory 2B (operational by 1Q 2020; 0.7b pieces), Factory 5A (operational by 1Q 2020; 2.5b pieces), Factory 40 (Phase 1 operational by 2Q 2020 and Phase 2 operational by 3Q 2020; 2.7b and 2.0b pieces), Factory F41 (2Q 2020; 4b pieces) and Factory 8A (by 4Q 2020; 3.5b pieces) to boost the group’s production capacity in 2020 by 11.8b gloves per annum to 81.9b (+17%).
Raised FY20E/FY211E net profit by 18%/28% after hiking our ASP from USD29/1,000 to USD32/1,000 and USD33/1000 pieces for FY20 and FY21, respectively.
Reiterate OP. Correspondingly, TP is raised from RM15.60 to RM20.10 based on unchanged 36x CY21E revised EPS of 55.9 sen (at slightly above +2.0SD above 5-year historical forward mean). Its merits are: (i) strong management, (ii) ability to supply in the current tight market conditions, and (iii) solid earnings growth averaging 105% per annum compared to FY20E and FY21E PERs of 40x and 28x, respectively. Historically, the stock moves ahead of two quarters of solid results.
A key risk to our call is lower-than-expected volume sales and ASP.

Out of these 84 companies following reviews, earnings downgrades overwhelmed upgrades by a ratio of 4 to 1. It would be safe to say for now that by the end of June when the remaining results are released, FY20E EPS of the FBMKLCI would bereduced by at least 7% to 78.5 sen and by 8% to 88.4 senforFY21EEPS.

Deep cuts to several FBMKLCI constituents’ FY20 EPS: As at end of May, 84 out of 138 companies in our research coverage have announced their results. So far, 40 (48%) came in within, 34 (40%) below, and 10 (12%) above, our expectations. Of the 26 FBMKLCI component stocks that have announced results, 9 (35%) were within, 13 (50%) below and only 4 (15%) were above. 13 of the FBMKLCI components’ forecast earnings were slashed, some severely while only 3 were raised. Notable severe cuts were CIMB (-28%), AXIATA (-25%), SIMEPLT (-34%), PETDAG (-48%), GENTING (-40%), GENM (-39%)and AIRPORT (- 68%) which outweighed upgrades in MISC (+32%), HARTA (+56%) and TOPGLOV (+103%).
Downgrades overwhelmed upgrades 4 to 1: Of the 84 stocks that have announced results, the team have cut forecasts for 43 stocks with just 11 upgrades (where rubber gloves stood out as the only one sector where all stocks’ earnings were raised). Sectors for which results are glaringly missing as at 31 May are automotive (only 2 of 6 announced), building materials (none of 4), construction (3 of 10), property (5 of 12) and technology (2 of 6). Those that have made the results announcements are rubber gloves (4 of 4), sin (3 of 3) and telecommunications (5 of 5).

Massive earnings explosion in the coming quarters will throw brokers’ forecasts out the window. We raise our Top Glove's FY20-22E EPS by 37%/180%/18% as we impute for ASP hikes and spot orders until 1QFY21. We highlight that our FY21E EPS is still conservative as we impute for zero ASP hikes and zero spot orders from 2QFY21.
Post-earnings revision and pegging at a lower CY21E P/E target of 23x (from 30x; +0.5 SD to 5-year mean), our new Target Price is MYR20.00 (+83%, from MYR10.95).
Top Glove is our top pick.
Optimism From the Glove Players
Global demand growth: +20% p.a. in 2020-21
The demand has surged since the outbreak of COVID-19 in Feb 2020. The initial additional demand came from Asia, followed by US, Europe and most recently from Latin America, Russia and India.
According to the glove players, global demand growth would have been stronger at 30-50% in 2020, if not for the capacity constraint. Hence, glove players expect the global demand growth to be just around 20% in 2020 and another 20% in 2021, with stock replenishment activities supporting the growth in 2021. We understand that the glove distributors and key consumers (i.e. hospitals and clinics) are holding zero or close to zero inventories presently.
Additionally, the demand is very dire with some glove buyers (i.e. government agencies, NGOs) buying at spot market price (3x higher than the normal ASPs), for the delivery time is shorter (vs. waiting time of 8-12 months for normal orders).
We also understand that the customers pay 10-50% of the orders as down payments to the glove-makers. This reduces the cancellation risk but the customers can still opt to defer the delivery in the event of overstocking/slower demand.
Capacity growth: +16% and +14% in 2020-21
For the world’s 5 largest glove producers, we estimate that the combined effective capacity growth is 16% and 14% in 2020-21 respectively. The world’s 5 largest glove producers account for 55% of global demand share. As the capacity growth lags that of demand growth, this has resulted in severe tight supply with the sales lead time for most players extended to 8-12 months (from 1-2 months before COVID-19).
ASPs Still Cheap Despite the Steep Hikes
Though the sales are secured for the next 8-12 months, we highlight that the ASPs are not locked-in and the glove players can still adjust the ASPs 2-3 months prior to the deliveries. Additionally, the indicative ASPs on the purchase orders are based on the +5% m-o-m increase trend. Hence, the customers that gave orders to the glove players are agreeable to the higher ASPs in 1H21.
Comparing the confirmed ASPs in Sep 2020 against Jan 2020, the ASPs for nitrile gloves and latex gloves have increased 40-50%. Though the ASP hikes are steep, we highlight that the ex-factory price for a pair of nitrile examination gloves is still very affordable at only USD0.06 per pair.
Sector-wide ASP Hikes and Spot Orders
The sector has seen monthly ASP hikes for most players since Mar 2020 and the ASP hikes are 3-10% m-o-m. Glove players are optimistic that the ASP hikes could last until mid-2021 as they expect the stock replenishment activity to support the demand in 2021 and tight supply situation to persist.
There is also spot orders (i.e. urgent orders) with high ASPs (3x of normal ASPs) that would boost the glove players’ earnings. Spot orders accounts for 10% of Top Glove’s sales volume.
Our Earnings Forecasts for Top Glove
We raise our Top Glove's FY20-22E EPS by 37%/180%/18% as we:
Raise our blended ASP assumptions by 8%/39%/2% for FY20-22E. This assumes for monthly ASP hikes from Mar to Nov 2020 (3QFY20- 1QFY21) and spot orders from May to Nov 2020 (3QFY20-1QFY21). Though the glove players are certain that they will continue to raise ASPs in 1H21, we conservatively assume that there will be no ASP hikes and no spot orders from Dec 2020 (2QFY21) onwards. Our FY21E ASP growth is 35% and we assume for its FY22E ASP to fall 35% (revert to pre-COVID 19 level);
Raise our sales volume by 1%/14%/7% in FY20-22E as we update for its latest expansion schedule and also assume for a higher plant utilisation rate of 94% in FY21 (from 89% previously).
Prior to our earnings revision, every 1% increase in ASP would result in 4% increase in our FY21E net profit. However, post-earnings revision, because of the higher ASP base now, every 1% change in the ASP will only increase our FY21E net profit by 2%. Below is our scenario analysis under different ASP hikes.
We forecast Top Glove's quarterly net profit of MYR247m/MYR659m/MYR950m for 3QFY20/4QFY20/1QFY21.
Note that our 1QFY21E net profit accounts for 30% of our FY21E net profit as we assume for zero ASP hikes and zero spot orders from 2QFY21.

Despite possible vaccine discoveries in the near term, scaling up manufacturing capacity to achieve global herd immunity could take 12 months in the best-case scenario. This underlines our expectation of demand being sustained in 2021.
Valuations have yet to fully factor in an impending and sustained earnings surge.
Top pick: Top Glove
What’s New
Close to 300 vaccines and treatments in the pipeline but success rate is 10% or less. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about an unprecedented urgency to develop a vaccine or treatment. To date, based on Milken Institute, there are 111 vaccines and 197 treatments in the pipeline to treat and prevent COVID-19. The critical mass of vaccines and treatments is imperative, given the success rate of the candidates is typically 10% or less based on preclinical studies through clinical trials to licensure, according to a study by Boston Consulting Group (BCG).
Possible discovery of a vaccine or treatment over next 1-2 quarters... At this juncture, there are two vaccines and six treatment drugs at Phase III of clinical trials. Phase III is the last stage prior to the drug being approved, provided it has proven safety and efficacy. Thus, it may be possible for a breakthrough vaccine or treatment in the next 1-2 quarters.
…but will take 12-18 months to achieve global manufacturing scale needed for herd immunity. However, once a vaccine is successfully validated, it must be produced at a scale that can enable herd immunity. BCG estimates this translates into coverage of more than 60% of the world’s population, which would require up to 5b doses for a vaccine. The production needed to reach such a global manufacturing scale would take for at least 12 to 18 months or 2Q-4Q21. 2Q21 is the best case timeline estimated by BCG.
ASPs have surged against backdrop of demand spike. Delivery lead times have extended to 11 months from the usual 30-45 days. ASP revisions have varied across all the producers, however they are broadly expected to continue to rise until end-20. That said, 3Q20 ASPs appear to have taken a significant step change q-o-q relative to 2Q20’s q-o-q mid-to high-single-digit growth.
Action
Upgrade to OVERWEIGHT from MARKET WEIGHT. We turn more bullish on the sector as ASPs surge past our expectations. Aside from that, we believe elevated demand could be well sustained up till 2Q-4Q21, underpinning our 2021 earnings outlook. We believe profit taking upon discovery of a vaccine may be too premature. A more reflective measure is potential shortening of delivery lead times and sharp ASP reversions. However, glove usage is likely to remain widespread until a vaccine and/or treatment production achieves global manufacturing scale in 2Q-4Q21 in a best-case scenario. Our upgrade to OVERWEIGHT is premised on:
multi-fold valuation gain have yet to fully factor in the impending earnings surge over the quarters ahead;
sustained glove demand over 2021; and
scarcity of safe haven earnings growth (2-year earnings CAGR of 43% in 2019-21) as most other sectors face multitude of headwinds.
Our top pick for the sector is Top Glove.
Aside from our BUY on Kossan, a high proportion of OBM sales and the possession of its own distribution positions Supermax as a forefront beneficiary of the surge in glove ASP.
ASP base expectation: Peak in late-20 to early-21 before trending downwards gradually. Overall, our base assumption is for ASPs to peak in late-20 to early-21 before gradually trending down across 2021. However, given the low base in 1Q20, we expect average ASP to grow y-o-y in 2021. Instances of a second wave of COVID-19 infection or overall emergency restocking have prompted elevated demand. For example, despite China containing COVID-19 by early-March, some glove producers are still receiving double the usual orders.
Bumper year for 2020 but post previous outbreaks, volume growth have averaged only -1%. The Malaysian Rubber Glove Manufacturers Association (MARGMA) expects industry volume to grow to 345b pieces in 2020 (from 298b), a surge from the average 10- year growth of 8-10%. Notably, in post-pandemic periods, volumes contracted only 1%. We believe demand growth is supply-capped, arising from producers operating at already maximum utilisation rates. Thus, it is possible for an overspill of demand into 2021-22.
Still unable to meet demand despite capacity surge. Ytd, the Big-3 producers have their expansion plans intact. We expect capacity additions of close to 7%, 10% and 19% for Hartalega, Kossan and Top Glove respectively. Other producers such as Sri Trang, Riverstone, Comfort Gloves and Rubberex are expected to see a capacity addition of 23% and all producers would collectively add 17% to total capacity for 2020. While it outstrips historical demand growth of 8-10%, it coincides well with the surge in demand. However, it falls considerably short of meeting demand, as reflected by delivery lead times of 11 months.
Raw material prices continue to trend lower. Going forward, operating margins could be aided by a slump in raw material prices. Latex prices have declined 9.5% from 1Q20, given soft latex demand (30% of demand is derived from rubber tyres). Meanwhile, nitrile prices are 8% lower in May. According to our calculations, every 1% drop in raw materials costs could boost earnings by 1-4%. That said, we do not expect any cost savings pass through, seeing the imbalance in demand-supply dynamics.
Potential upside from our RM/US$ assumption. We have a RM4.30/US$ assumption for 2020-21. However, should the ringgit depreciate further from our assumption, our calculations show that every 1% depreciation of the ringgit vs the US dollar could beef up glove makers’ earnings by up to 4% (this excludes the shared cost savings mechanism with customers which will consequently moderate any significant gain in margins).
We have revised our earnings forecasts and assumptions based on our more bullish outlook for the sector.
We expect ASPs to peak in late-20 to early-21, followed by a gradual downtrend over the rest of 2021. However, given that ASPs were not inflated in 1Q20, we expectASPs to remain higher y-o-y in 2021.
ASPs across the three producers vary because of:
their different year ends;
how ASPs trended over 2019 in relation to the respective glove companies’ year-ends; and
the varying ASP locked in for the respective companies.
The economies of scale are not fully realised as we expect glove companies’ effective tax rates (Top Glove: 13%, Hartalega: 21%, Kossan: 19%) to normalise closer to the corporate tax rate of 24%. This arises due to the bumper year in earnings against the companies’ unchanged capital allowance.
Based on our revised ASP assumptions, we raise Top Glove’s FY20-21 net profit forecasts by 55% and 118% respectively; and Hartalega’s FY21-22 net profit forecasts by 5% and 71% respectively. We had earlier factored in our more bullish outlook into Kossan’s earnings.
Top Glove Corporation (BUY/Target: RM14.72)
Upgrade to BUY from HOLD with a higher target price of RM14.72 (from RM6.05). Our target price is based on 29.5x 2021F PE, or +1SD of its 3-year forward PE mean. Top Glove is best poised to benefit from the surge in ASPs by virtue of possessing the highest operating leverage. The premium is also fair as Top Glove pivots into the generally faster-growing nitrile glove space and captures the gradual re-rating from its inclusion into the FBMKLCI, catching up to Hartalega.
Using the latest FX rate of 1RM to 0.3255SGD, we derive target price of 4.79 in SGD term.
Kossan Rubber Industries (KRI MK/BUY/Target: RM10.00)
Our recommendation and target price are maintained as we had previously factored in our more bullish assumptions into Kossan’s valuations. Our target price is based on 23x 2020F PE, or +1SD of its 3-year mean PE. This factors in the attractive 2-year earnings CAGR of 69% over 2019-21).
We believe consistent execution and growth, backed by its Bidor development, could eventually translate to a multi-year earnings compounder for Kossan. Therefore, we believe its valuations should narrow closer to that of Hartalega and Top Glove.
Hartalega Holdings (HART MK/HOLD/Target: RM10.24)
Upgrade to HOLD from SELL with a higher target price of RM10.24 (from RM7.36). Our target price is based on 45.0x 2021F PE, or its +2SD of its 3-year forward PE mean. The premium can be justified by Hartelega’s strong operating efficiency under ordinary circumstances and innovation ahead of peers. Aside from that, the Next Generation Manufacturing Complex (NGC) 2.0 provides visibility over medium-term growth.
Nevertheless, our HOLD call is premised on Hartalega’s valuations being priced in at this juncture, which limits potential price upside. Entry price is RM9.00.
Risk
Discovery of a vaccine and/or treatment could cause negative newsflow, however, as we have previously highlighted, scaling of global manufacturing to achieve herd immunity may take 12 months and beyond. Aside from that, peak mass testing may translate into lower glove demand as well.
Downside risks are spikes in raw materials costs, a strengthening ringgit, sharp ASP reversion and COVID-19 outbreak among the production workforce. Upside risks are supply disruption to the broader industry and a strengthening US$.

This has in turn increased ASP alongside higher utilisation rates. We raise the earnings forecast of our coverage to reflect this and also apply higher valuation PE multiples (from +1.5SD to +2SD). Our top pick remains the market leader Top Glove, Hartalega is upgraded from Hold to BUY, Kossan remains a HOLD while Karex is upgraded from Sell to HOLD. As the outlook for rubber glove producers looks promising given stronger demand driven by Covid-19, we upgrade our sector rating to OVERWEIGHT (from Neutral).
Covid-19. Since WHO declared Covid-19 a pandemic (11 Mar), the virus’ spread has been exponential especially in the US and Europe; naturally, expect glove producers will benefit from higher demand for its products. Furthermore, there are chances of 2nd
wave to re-emerge alongside no vaccine within the near horizon (health experts say 12-18 months). Alongside, better hygiene/preventative measures and the resulting sustained higher demand for gloves, share prices have re-rated of late.
Key drivers. Our channel checks reveal that all glove companies under our coverage have seen a surge in demand for gloves. We also understand that these increased orders are on a higher ASP since the Covid-19 outbreak (c.6% blended). Apart from that, with the additional lead time (c.5 months blended vs. pre Covid-19 of 1-2 months), we reckon utilisation rates have surged to above 95% (from c.80-85% pre Covid-19) and we expect it to maintain this way for the rest of 2020.
Top Glove. Being the world’s largest glove manufacturer, Top Glove has received surge in orders in tandem with the current strong global glove demand. Lead time of 1-1.5 month pre Covid-19 outbreak, has rose to c.11 months. Utilisation rate pre Covid-19 stood at 85%, but has now increased to c. 97%. An increase of ASP by c.9% was achieved since Feb to date, and we expect it to sustain until year end. Top Glove also is exploring to diversify their product range to face masks, which they intend to start production in 2H20. We increase FY20-22 earnings by 60%/72%/37% to reflect higher ASP and utilisation. Furthermore, we take this opportunity to adjust our valuation PE target from 35x to 41x (+2SD above 5-year mean) which increases our TP to RM13.50 (from RM7.40). Our TP is based on mid FY21 pegged against PE multiple of 41.05x. Maintain our BUY call and our top pick for the sector.
Hartalega. We adjusted earnings post FY20 results (published today). We gather that ASP has increased c.4% since Covid-19 while utilisation rate remains above 90%. Further increases for both are likely going forward, mirroring peers (ASP: c.7%). Hence, we increase FY21-22 earnings by 43%/38%. We also take the opportunity to roll forward our valuation to FY21, and apply a PE of 46.5x (+2SD from 5-year mean) from 42x. This raises our TP to RM10.08 (from RM5.99), upgrade to BUY (from HOLD).
Kossan. We comprehend that since Covid-19, Kossan’s ASP has increased by c.4% while utilisation has increased to c.90% (from 80%). We opine both its ASP and utilisation will continue to increase closer to peers (c.7%). With that, we raise FY20-21 earnings forecast by 31%/17% and roll forward our valuation to FY21, tagged to a higher PE of 31.4x (+2SD) from 27x. This increases our TP to RM8.11 (from RM5.00). Maintain HOLD. Results are expected to be released on 21st May.
Karex. We understand a global shortage of condoms is looming, as lockdowns globally have disrupted production and somewhat increased demand. With Karex being the largest condom maker globally, we feel it may benefit via higher ASPs. The MCO (started 18 Mar) stopped Karex’s production for the first 10 days’ but fortunately, it was subsequently granted permission to restart but with only 50% of its workforce.
As we understand, since Covid-19, Karex’s ASP has been on an upward trend, possibly due to other smaller domestic manufacturers that were not able to operate during MCO and/or faced hiccups in obtaining raw materials. Nonetheless, the positives of higher ASPs will only be felt in a more profound manner from FY21 onwards as the near-term impact could be partially offset by lower utilisation from the MCO (i.e. 10 days of production loss followed by 50% operative scale up until 29 Apr). We revise FY20-22 earnings upwards by 15%/33%/6% and increased our valuation to PB multiple of 1.2x (-1SD below mean) from 0.75x. Thus, our TP increases to RM0.59 (RM0.36); in view of the less murky outlook we upgrade our call to HOLD (from Sell).
Upgrade to OVERWEIGHT. As the outlook for rubber glove producers looks promising given stronger demand driven by Covid-19, we take the opportunity to upgrade our sector rating to OVERWEIGHT (from Neutral). Our top sector pick remains the market leader, Top Glove.

Hence, we raised our FY20E/FY21E net profit by 15%/27%, to account for higher ASPs. TP is raised from RM12.60 to RM15.60 based on unchanged 36x CY21E revised EPS. Reiterate Outperform.
Abnormal demand leading to acute shortage and higher-thanexpected ASP. We highlight that the market is still under-appreciating the potential impact from higher-than-expected ASPs in this continuing pandemic and tight supply condition. Due to the tight supply, we expect buyers to jockey for position in order to secure allocation which will push up ASPs. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) of which glove is one of the components is presently much sought after due to limited supply. Longer delivery lead times are indicating that demand will outstrip supply at least over the medium-term. In the most recent analysts’ briefing, management highlighted that requests for huge volumes of gloves to the tune of 400m to 500m pieces are coming from countries that include Spain, France, Italy, Germany, and Saudi Arabia. This lends us the confidence that mid to high-teens growth in volume sales are achievable in FY20 and FY21 since orders have been secured up till end Dec 2020 to early 2021. The robust demand has led to longer delivery lead times which has risen to >300 days from 80 to 100 days compared to two months ago.
Subsequent quarters’ earnings to be driven by higher volume sales and higher-than-expected ASPs. Initially in the early stage of the virus outbreak, sales orders came mainly from China, Hong Kong, Singapore and South Korea. As the pandemic spread westwards, TOPGLOV has also subsequently, received strong orders from Europe, US and other countries. With current utilisation levels at >90%, the group is able to further ramp up production close to 100%, to meet the surge in demand. It has new capacity that came on-stream with F2B and F5A having commenced operations recently, which added 3.2b pieces of gloves per annum.
Capacity expansion include: Factory 7A (operational by end-1Q 2020; 0.4bn pieces), Factory 2B (operational by 1Q 2020; 0.7b pieces), Factory 5A (operational by 1Q 2020; 2.5b pieces), Factory 40 (Phase 1 operational by 2Q 2020 and Phase 2 operational by 3Q 2020; 2.7b and 2.0b pieces), Factory F41 (2Q 2020; 4b pieces) and Factory 8A (by 4Q 2020; 3.5b pieces) to boost the group’s production capacity in 2020 by 11.8b gloves per annum to 81.9b (+17%).
Raised FY20E/FY211E net profit by 15%/27% after hiking our ASP from USD26/1,000 to USD29/1,000 for both FY20 and FY21.
Reiterate OP. Correspondingly, TP is raised from RM12.60 to RM15.60 based on 36x CY21E EPS of 43.5 sen (at slightly above +2.0SD above 5-year historical forward mean). Its merits are: (i) strong management, (ii) ability to supply in the current tight market conditions, and (iii) solid earnings growth averaging 79% per annum compared to FY20E and FY21E PERs of 36x and 27x, respectively.
A key risk to our call is lower-than-expected volume sales and margin.

The strong performance was due to the latest guidance provided by companies indicating that there is a high likelihood that ASP could increase by 5-8%/mth starting June, which is significantly higher than the 1-3% that we had anticipated. As such, we are raising our earnings growth forecast for the sector, along with our EPS estimates and target prices for the 4 companies under coverage. We maintain our Overweight call with Top Glove and Kossan as our top BUYs for the sector and country. We also raise Harta to BUY from Hold.
Demand Continues to Remain Robust
Demand for rubber gloves has continued to surprise us on the upside, as some manufacturers have started accepting orders for delivery 1 year in advance with 20% deposits. The strong demand has also given manufacturers the flexibility to continue raising selling prices, which we are now forecasting at 5-8%/mth starting from June, higher than the 1- 2%/mth we forecasted earlier. Although selling prices will only be confirmed 1-2 months prior to delivery, buyers are still likely to take delivery or risk losing their deposits.
Record Earnings for 2020
With the current robust demand, we believe that the sector should achieve record earnings in 2020. Unless COVID-19 is no longer a threat, the robust demand for rubber gloves is likely to stay. Given that we are only expecting a 10%-12% increase in (effective) capacity in 2020, we believe that there will still be shortages of gloves in 2021, although the problem is not as severe as currently experienced. As such, we are forecasting ASP to increase by around 3-5% for the whole 2021. However, we believe that demand could ease if a vaccine for COVID-19 is available to the public.
Positive Sentiment Pushes Share Prices Higher
Although the sector PER is currently trading above +2SD of its historical average, we don’t think that valuations are overstretched yet as there could still be upside risk to the earnings forecasts given that we have assumed demand to normalize by 2H21. We are not expecting any negative surprises in the earnings of the glove companies, for at least the next few quarters, as we do not foresee any execution risk. The strong earnings growth would likely help to re-rate the sector further.
Still Not Time to Take Profit Yet
As such we are maintaining our Overweight call on the sector, as we believe that there is a high certainty on the sector earnings. Top Glove and Kossan remains our top BUY pick for the sector and country. Meanwhile, we also raise Harta from a Hold to Buy.

We raise our recommendation on Top Glove Corporation (Top Glove) to BUY from HOLD with a higher fair value of RM12.23/share (RM6.28/share previously).
Our valuation is based on 33x FY21F EPS. Our multiple is at a premium of the stock’s average forward PE of 25x (preCovid-19).
We increase our earnings forecasts by 98% for FY20F, 95% for FY21F and by 20% for FY22F. This is underpinned by increased demand as the Covid-19 pandemic persists, assuming it lasts another 12 months. We estimate that Top Glove’s net margins to be around 12.7% in FY20F, 11.5% in FY21F and 8.5% in FY22F.
We believe Top Glove is one of the largest beneficiaries of the Covid-19 pandemic due to its highly diversified customer base, which allows the company more freedom for selling price adjustments.
Top Glove’s expansion plans, as shown in Exhibit 1, remain intact. Its production capacity is expected to grow by around 20% YoY to 76bil pieces per annum in FY20F, 10% to 86bil pieces in FY21F and 7% to 96bil pieces in FY22F.
We are increasing our sales volume assumption by 6% for FY20F and 5% for FY21F as plant utilisation is expected to be maxed out at 95–100% levels in FY20F before tapering in FY21F where we assume 85% utilisation rate.
We also raise our ASP assumption by 45% to US$29 in FY20F, 40% to US$28 in FY21F and 18% to US$24 in FY22F.
Recall that during the previous major pandemic outbreak, Top Glove’s earnings and share price were affected. At the start of the 2009–2010 H1N1 pandemic, Top Glove’s share price was RM0.73 and it rose to RM1.80 by the end as shown in Exhibit 1.
Previously during the H1N1 pandemic, Top Glove’s revenue and net profit expanded 36.0% and 38.6% respectively in FY10 as demand soared. This resulted in a 0.3ppt improvement in net margins (11.8% in FY10).
Top Glove’s 1-year average trading P/E was 11.2x before the WHO declared H1N1 as a pandemic. Its P/E peaked at 20.2x (+7.2SDs) in April 2010.
We like Top Glove for its: (1) expansionary plans; (2) focus and continual efforts in improving quality and operational efficiencies; and (3) position as the world’s largest rubber glove manufacturer.

This has in turn increased ASP alongside higher utilisation rates. We raise the earnings forecast of our coverage to reflect this and also apply higher valuation PE multiples (from +1.5SD to +2SD). Our top pick remains the market leader Top Glove, Hartalega is upgraded from Hold to BUY, Kossan remains a HOLD while Karex is upgraded from Sell to HOLD. As the outlook for rubber glove producers looks promising given stronger demand driven by Covid-19, we upgrade our sector rating to OVERWEIGHT (from Neutral).
Covid-19. Since WHO declared Covid-19 a pandemic (11 Mar), the virus’ spread has been exponential especially in the US and Europe; naturally, expect glove producers will benefit from higher demand for its products. Furthermore, there are chances of 2nd
wave to re-emerge alongside no vaccine within the near horizon (health experts say 12- 18 months). Alongside, better hygiene/preventative measures and the resulting sustained higher demand for gloves, share prices have re-rated of late.
Key drivers. Our channel checks reveal that all glove companies under our coverage have seen a surge in demand for gloves. We also understand that these increased orders are on a higher ASP since the Covid-19 outbreak (c.6% blended). Apart from that, with the additional lead time (c.5 months blended vs. pre Covid-19 of 1-2 months), we reckon utilisation rates have surged to above 95% (from c.80-85% pre Covid-19) and we expect it to maintain this way for the rest of 2020.
Top Glove. Being the world’s largest glove manufacturer, Top Glove has received surge in orders in tandem with the current strong global glove demand. Lead time of 1- 1.5 month pre Covid-19 outbreak, has rose to c.11 months. Utilisation rate pre Covid- 19 stood at 85%, but has now increased to c. 97%. An increase of ASP by c.9% was achieved since Feb to date, and we expect it to sustain until year end. Top Glove also is exploring to diversify their product range to face masks, which they intend to start production in 2H20. We increase FY20-22 earnings by 60%/72%/37% to reflect higher ASP and utilisation. Furthermore, we take this opportunity to adjust our valuation PE target from 35x to 41x (+2SD above 5-year mean) which increases our TP to RM13.50 (from RM7.40). Our TP is based on mid FY21 pegged against PE multiple of 41.05x. Maintain our BUY call and our top pick for the sector.
Hartalega. We adjusted earnings post FY20 results (published today). We gather that ASP has increased c.4% since Covid-19 while utilisation rate remains above 90%. Further increases for both are likely going forward, mirroring peers (ASP: c.7%). Hence, we increase FY21-22 earnings by 43%/38%. We also take the opportunity to roll forward our valuation to FY21, and apply a PE of 46.5x (+2SD from 5-year mean) from 42x. This raises our TP to RM10.08 (from RM5.99), upgrade to BUY (from HOLD).
Kossan. We comprehend that since Covid-19, Kossan’s ASP has increased by c.4% while utilisation has increased to c.90% (from 80%). We opine both its ASP and utilisation will continue to increase closer to peers (c.7%). With that, we raise FY20-21 earnings forecast by 31%/17% and roll forward our valuation to FY21, tagged to a higher PE of 31.4x (+2SD) from 27x. This increases our TP to RM8.11 (from RM5.00). Maintain HOLD. Results are expected to be released on 21st May.
Karex. We understand a global shortage of condoms is looming, as lockdowns globally have disrupted production and somewhat increased demand. With Karex being the largest condom maker globally, we feel it may benefit via higher ASPs. The MCO (started 18 Mar) stopped Karex’s production for the first 10 days’ but fortunately, it was subsequently granted permission to restart but with only 50% of its workforce. As we understand, since Covid-19, Karex’s ASP has been on an upward trend, possibly due to other smaller domestic manufacturers that were not able to operate during MCO and/or faced hiccups in obtaining raw materials. Nonetheless, the positives of higher ASPs will only be felt in a more profound manner from FY21 onwards as the near-term impact could be partially offset by lower utilisation from the MCO (i.e. 10 days of production loss followed by 50% operative scale up until 29 Apr). We revise FY20-22 earnings upwards by 15%/33%/6% and increased our valuation to PB multiple of 1.2x (-1SD below mean) from 0.75x. Thus, our TP increases to RM0.59 (RM0.36); in view of the less murky outlook we upgrade our call to HOLD (from Sell).
Upgrade to OVERWEIGHT. As the outlook for rubber glove producers looks promising given stronger demand driven by Covid-19, we take the opportunity to upgrade our sector rating to OVERWEIGHT (from Neutral). Our top sector pick remains the market leader, Top Glove

Demand for rubber gloves grew tremendously starting from the month of January, subsequently leading to a global shortage of rubber gloves. As a result, Top Glove has also secured orders for delivery in April 2021. We raise our earnings projections for FY20-21F by 55-71% to account for the stronger sales volume, higher ASP and margin expansion. We also roll over our valuation to CY21F earnings, raising our TP to RM12.70, pegged to a PE multiple of 43x (at +2SD of its 5-year historical mean) and we maintain our Outperform call. Downside risk to our call include possible derating should the Covid-19 pandemic subsides.
Clear winner of Covid-19. As the Covid-19 pandemic worsens across the globe, demand for rubber gloves continues to grow, with Top Glove securing orders up till April 2021. Lead time for rubber gloves has also increased to 6-12 months (as opposed to its normal level of 1-1.5 months prior to the Covid-19 outbreak), depending on the type of gloves. Lead time for surgical gloves are on the lower end of the spectrum of 6 months, as hospitals are scaling back on elective surgeries. ASP for rubber gloves has also been on an uptrend since the demand surge starting end-January and we expect the strong ASP to sustain, given the current global shortage in rubber gloves. Top Glove has also received additional ad-hoc orders, of which they generally fetch higher ASP compared to the normal recurring orders, and we are of view that such orders could help lift Top Glove’s margins further. Utilization rate for Top Glove has also peaked to c.97%, much higher compared to its Pre-Covid-19 days of c.85%.
Expansion plan. Top Glove’s current capacity stands at 73.8bn pcs pa, with 700 lines installed. The commissioning of F40’s 1st Phase (+2.7bn pcs pa) has been delayed from 2QCY20 to 3QCY20, due to a delay in construction caused by the implementation of MCO. With the other few expansions in the pipeline, Top Glove’s total capacity should grow to 84bn pcs pa (+19% YoY) by the end of CY20 and 91bn pcs pa (+8% YoY) by the end of CY21.
Imputing the positives and expecting stronger 2HFY20. Our FY20- 21F earnings projections have been raised upward by 55-71% as we revise our revenue assumption upwards to account for the stronger sales volume and higher ASP, as well as margins expansion arising from operational efficiencies, lower raw material costs and a weaker MYR.

The current view is that a change of government is unlikely, which should be positive for the market. Further, the market is now looking forward to end-May when the government is expected to announce its stimulus package for the economy.
Event
MQ Research hosted political analyst, Jahabar Sadiq, on a Macquarie Insights call on Friday morning (15 May) to get his views on the ongoing political situation in Malaysia. In conclusion, Jahabar feels that a vote of confidence is unlikely to materialise soon and even if it did, the chances of a change in government are low. This should be positive for the market as it should at the very least remove a layer of uncertainty that may be clouding investors’ perception.
Separately MQ Research has tried to gauge the level of activity in the Malaysian economy using data from the World Air Quality Index and Google Earth’s Engine, which uses data from Copernicus Sentinel Data. In summary, based on these data sets, activity levels have picked up since the lifting of the MCO, but appear to be below levels in 2019.
Impact
Politics – noisy but unlikely to impact. With the leader of Parti Keadilan Rakyat, a key component (39 out of 92 MPs) of the Opposition, Anwar Ibrahim is said to have given his word not to file the motion; it is questionable if Tun Dr Mahathir has the numbers to have the motion passed. This should leave the Perikatan government in power and able to push through the much awaited post-MCO stimulus packages. Note that the vote of no confidence will not be carried out on 18 May. This means the earliest it can be held is during the July/August parliamentary sitting. Jahabar believes the more likely timing of the vote will be during the debate of the 2021 Budget in October/November.
Stimulus next. The market is now looking forward to end-May when the government is expected to announce its stimulus package for the economy. With many businesses still struggling, this will be an important event. According to Jahabar, key infra projects are on track despite the tight fiscal situation. MQ Research expects the MRT3 and potentially HSR projects to be key components of the post-MCO stimulus. Others including the Johor-Singapore RTS project could see light of day too.
The challenge? With PM Muhyiddin’s coalition partners seeking a bigger role in government, the move to political appointees to head government institutions is likely to continue. While not positive, MQ Research thinks the key for government linked companies (GLC) under its coverage will be that professional managers continue to drive the business and adhere to strict corporate governance. To that end, MQ Research believes there are sufficient checks and balances at least in the listed space.
Outlook
Reduced risk of a further change in government should be positive for the market and the construction sector in particular. Within construction GAM and ECON remain MQ Research’s top picks. MQ Research also continues to favour global leaders/exporters (TOPG, PCHEM, SDPL, IHH), defensives (TNB, RAHH, telcos) and selected banks (CIMB, RHBBANK).

Amplifying the growth spurt is restocking activities reinforced by the pandemic with longer delivery lead times indicating that demand will outstrip supply at least over the medium-term. Hence, we raised our FY21E/FY22E net profit by 22%/19%, to account for higher ASPs. TP is raised from RM9.30 to RM11.66 based on 52x CY21E EPS. Reiterate OP.
Consensus under-appreciating higher ASPs’ impact. We highlight that market consensus is under-appreciating the potential impact from higher-than-expected ASPs in this continuing pandemic and tight supply condition. Due to the tight supply, we expect buyers to jockey for position in order to secure allocation which will push up ASPs. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) of which glove is one of the components is presently much sought after due to limited supply. Longer delivery lead times are indicating that demand will outstrip supply at least over the medium-term. We believe HARTA will benefit from robust demand which has led to industry longer delivery lead times (the moment order is placed to delivery) which has risen to an average of between 120 to 150 days as compared to 40 to 50 days normally. We understand that industry has raised prices by 3-5% in anticipation of higher demand and we also noted the industry current high >90% utilisation rate for nitrile-centric players which is a stark contrast compared to the lacklustre demand in 2019. However, we are more bullish on higher ASPs in 2H 2020 due to the present tight situation of buyers jockeying for position to secure allocation.
Higher volume sales and ASP; longer delivery lead times. Longer delivery lead times are indicating that demand will outstrip supply at least over the medium-term. The Malaysian Rubber Glove Manufacturers Association has forecast a 20% demand growth to 230b pieces in 2020. We believe HARTALEGA will benefit from robust demand which has led to longer delivery lead times (the moment order is placed to delivery) which has risen to an average of between 80 to 100 days as compared to 40 to 50 days normally. Signs of demand outstripping supply could potentially lead to higher ASPs coupled with incremental cost and higher opex.
Outlook. The first 4 lines of Plant 6 (installed capacity of 4.7b pieces) have commenced commercial operations and the remaining 8 lines are expected to be gradually ramped up. Plant 7 is expected to be commissioned by end 2020 or early 2021, which will focus on small orders as well as specialty products with an installed capacity of 3.4b pieces. All in, Plant 5, 6 and 7 will add a total capacity of 12.1b pieces, raising installed capacity to 43.7b pieces per annum.
Raised FY21E/FY22E net profit by 22%/19% after imputing: (i) higher ASP from USD22/1,000 pieces to USD26/1,000 pieces for each year, and ((ii) higher utilisation rate of 92%/95% to 96%/97%, respectively.
Reiterate OP. YTD, the stock is up 68% and looking at the previous upcycle when the stock rose 200%, this indicates potential further upside. TP is raised from RM9.30 to RM11.66 based on 52x CY21E revised EPS (at slightly >+2.0SD above 5-year historical forward mean) from 50x previously. We like HART for: (i) a solid management, (ii) constantly evolving via innovative products development, and (iii) its booming nitrile gloves segment.
Risks to our call: lower-than-expected ASPs and volume sales.

Higher volume and ASPs in 2HFY20 with production running >90%. We highlight that market consensus is still under-appreciating the potential impact from higher-than-expected ASPs in this continuing pandemic and tight supply condition. Due to the tight supply, we expect buyers to jockey for position in order to secure allocation which will push up ASPs. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) of which glove is one of the components is presently much sought after due to limited supply.

Recall, in the previous analyst briefing, management highlighted that requests for huge volumes of gloves to the tune of 400m to 500m pieces are coming from countries including Spain, France, Italy, Germany, and Saudi Arabia. Correspondingly, we are confident of mid to high-teens growth in volume sales in FY20 and FY21 since orders have been secured up till end Dec 2020 to early 2021. The robust demand has led to longer delivery lead time which has risen to between >200 days from 80 to 100 days compared to two months ago.
Subsequent quarters’ earnings to be driven by higher volume sales and higher-than-expected ASPs. Initially in the early stage of the virus outbreak, sales orders came mainly from China, Hong Kong, Singapore and South Korea. TOPGLOV has also received strong orders from Europe, US and other countries. With current utilisation levels at >90%, the group is able to further ramp up production close to 100%, to meet the surge in demand. It has new capacity coming on-stream with F2B and F5A having commenced operations, which will add 3.2b pieces of gloves per annum. Ceteris paribus, each 1% increase in volume sales and ASP will raise our FY20E and FY21E net profit by 1% and 1.2%, respectively.
Capacity expansion include: Factory 7A (operational by end-1Q 2020; 0.4bn pieces), Factory 2B (operational by 1Q 2020; 0.7b pieces), Factory 5A (operational by 1Q 2020; 2.5b pieces), Factory 40 (Phase 1 operational by 2Q 2020 and Phase 2 operational by 3Q 2020; 2.7b and 2.0b pieces), Factory F41 (2Q 2020; 4b pieces) and Factory 8A (by 4Q 2020; 3.5b pieces) to boost the group’s production capacity in 2020 by 11.8b gloves per annum to 81.9b (+17%).
Raised FY20E/FY21E net profit by 41%/61% after taking into account higher growth for volume sales from 13%/16% to 15%/28% and ASP from USD21/1000 pieces to USD26/1000 pieces.
Upgrade from MP to OP. Correspondingly, TP is raised from RM6.50 to RM12.60 based on revised 36x CY21E EPS of 35.0 sen (at +2.0SD above 5-year historical forward mean) compared to 32x previously. We roll forward our valuation from CY20E to CY21E. Its merits are: (i) strong management, (ii) capacity to supply in the current tight market conditions, and (iii) solid earnings growth averaging 56% per annum compared to FY20E and FY21E PERs of 33x and 27x, respectively.
A key risk to our call is lower-than-expected volume sales and margin.

With Top Glove's sales secured until Apr 2021 and some of its peers’ capacities also locked-in for the next 6-12 months, we expect the present positive environment to sustain into 1Q21. We raise our FY20-22E EPS by 54%/112%/5%, projecting for its EPS to increase by 128%/35% in FY20-21E and to fall 50% in FY22E.
Based on an unchanged CY21 P/E of 30x (+1SD to mean), our target price is raised to MYR10.95 (+73%).
Key catalyst is its potentially superb upcoming 3QFY8/20 results (to release on 18th Jun).
Secured Orders Until Apr 2021
Top Glove has secured orders until Apr 2021 with its sales lead time stretched to 10 months now (from 5 months in Apr 2020 and 1.5 months before the COVID-19 outbreak). However, the ASPs quoted to customers are indicative ASPs and could still be revised 1-2 months prior to the deliveries.
Also, there have been some ad-hoc orders (c.3-5% of quarterly total sales) with ASPs substantially higher than the market’s ASPs. Top Glove's plant utilisaton rate has risen to 97% (from 85% in 2QFY8/20) and it is sticking to its expansion schedule (refer to Figure3 in attached PDF report).
Sector-wide ASP Hikes
In addition to Top Glove, we also note that other key players have fully-sold their capacities for the next 6-12 months (Kossan: sold until end- 2020, Sri Trang: latex gloves capacity is sold until Mar 2021 while nitrile is sold until Jun 2021). The sector ASPs have been rising since Mar 2020 and we expect the present ASPs to sustain into 1Q21.
3QFY8/20: to Beat Consensus Significantly
We expect Top Glove's net profit of MYR220m (+90% q-o-q, +2.9x y-o-y) on:
higher sales volume (+c.15% q-o-q, +c.14% y-o-y);
EBITDA margin of 22% (2QFY20: 17%) on better ASP and higher operating leverage.
We also expect Top Glove’s 4QFY20 net profit to be even higher at MYR350m based on our assumed revenue growth of 15% q-o-q and EBITDA margin of 28%.
Our FY20-22E EPS is raised by 45%/107%/19% respectively, as we raise our ASP assumptions, which resulted in substantial EBITDA margin expansion of 3.8-ppt/7.3-ppt/0-ppt in FY20-22E.

    TOP GLOVE  is the world's largest manufacturer of gloves. Founded by Tan Sri Dr Lim Wee Chai and Puan Sri Tong Siew Bee in 1991, it was listed on the Second Board of Bursa Malaysia in March 2001, then promoted within 14 months to the Main Board in May 2002.
  Top Glove also manufactures and sells natural rubber, nitrile, and vinyl gloves. It is the world’s largest glove manufacturer with 26% of market share globally and aims to grow its market share to 30% by 2020. Top Glove currently has an annual manufacturing capacity of 64 billion pieces of gloves.
  In terms of capacity we saw its market capitalisation (cap) hit a record high near of RM20 billion. In the span of about four and a half months, Top Glove’s market cap has ballooned by about 41.91% or RM5.06 billion, following unprecedented demand spikes in protective medical equipment like rubber gloves amid the relentless spread of the Covid-19 pandemic.
  Now we agreed that glovemakers now more valuable than casino, airport operators. Notably, Top Glove’s market cap is now more than two times the market cap of Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd (MAHB), which stood at RM7.33 billion.  MAHB is the operator of all Malaysian airports. It also owns as well as manages an international airport in Turkey.
  In fact, Top Glove’s market cap has also topped the RM14.06 billion of KLCC Stapled Group, who is the proud owner of the Petronas Twin Towers, Menara ExxonMobil and several other prominent buildings in the Kuala Lumpur city centre.
          TOPGLOVE WILL HAVE A BIG SPIKE THIS MAY
    Top Glove will rises again to record high as Covid-19 global death toll near tops 200,000. So 
after rising to a record high on expectation that the Covid-19 pandemic, which has killed more than 190,000 people globally, will result in higher demand for rubber gloves as the healthcare sector contends with the rising number of infected individuals. Total Global cases now 2,833,697 and numbers of recovered 807,469. This base on the report at coronavirus.baselab.com
  So in my mind and I forsee, from nextweek till end of May. My darling Top Glove Corp Bhd will reach and hit my personel at TP1 (8.30 & TP2 (9.50)

    OUR TECHNICAL VIEW

WHAT KIM SAY?
  ""TOMORROW FLY TO RECORD A NEW HIGH AGAIN RM7.45""
  - Top Glove last 2 weeks when I noticed that  Employees Provident Fund (EPF) or I address them as a big-boys had exit. The news suprisingly me that they has ceased to become a substantial shareholder in Top Glove Corp Bhd after disposing of 3.08 million shares in the rubber glove manufacturer. EPF ceased to be a substantial shareholder in Top Glove on April 7. So I strongly believe this stock will go fly and surge very high to meet their real target and values. Its a time now as Malaysian glovemakers now more valuable than casino and airport operators. So my concern this sector to be benefit from stronger demand arising from the Covid-19 outbreak, and a weaker ringgit against the US dollar.
   - The results for for 3 consecutive years will be superb! Monitor very closely. 

- Top Glove price start from today onward till end of May. You will see this stock will surge very high to meet our target as above and one day it will cross HARTALEGA price. 
- Topglov has set aside a significant capital expenditure budget of RM600 million for its financial year ending 2020.
- Top Glove highlighting to investors that the world’s largest glove manufacturer is still “hungry for growth”.
- Top Glove boss expected the global glove demand is expected to grow 10 per cent annually. They will continue to expand to meet this increase in demand. As we know demand's now more than 100% due to Covid-19 pandemic.
- Top Glove value,  we cannot imagine and expect how much the real demand till this December 2020.
- Top Glove is expected to have 38 glove factories from the current 33 factories after spending RM632.17 million in capital outlay in financial year 2019 and RM461.77 million in financial year 2018. This would represent 876 production lines with maximum capacity of 84.1 billion gloves per annum.
- Top Glove said 80 per cent of capacity expansion in the next few years would mainly be for nitrile gloves, while the remaining is for vinyl and latex gloves. Currently, nitrile gloves were the major contributor to Top Glove’s revenue at 46 per cent, followed by latex (powdered and powder free) and surgical gloves.
 
      14 POINTS ABOUT TOP GLOVE WE LIKE
  1. Top Glove derives most of its sales from its export business to 195 countries. It distributes 20% of its gloves of its own brand directly to end users and through an online platform. Original equipment manufacturing (OEM) gloves contributes to 80% of its product portfolio. Its clients come from various sectors ranging from medical to manufacturing and food processing.

2. Top Glove aims to be a Bursa Malaysia Top 20 company by 2020 and Fortune Global 500 company by 2040. Top Glove is currently a constituent of the FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI that features the 30 largest companies on Bursa Malaysia. However, Top Glove was accused of compulsory labour, excessive overtime, debt bondage, and passport confiscation by The Guardian, and subsequently denied the allegations. The global market is key to Top Glove’s continued growth and chairman Tan Sri Dr Lim Wee Chai believes it’s important to follow the rules when doing business with the U.S. and Europe.

3. Top Glove foresaw that demand for natural rubber gloves would remain stable when it listed in March 2001 as synthetic gloves could not mimic the high elasticity and tensile strength of natural rubber gloves. Despite this, the demand for nitrile gloves has grown considerably. Nitrile gloves overtook latex-powdered gloves as Top Glove’s best-selling glove in 2017.
 
  4. The glove industry is a largely resilient one. Gloves are a necessity and cannot be reused for hygiene reasons. Global rubber glove consumption grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.0% from 2000 to 2018. Demand is expected to grow moving forward due to increasing healthcare standards, growing and aging populations, and increasing usage in the non-medical sectors.
 
  5. Some of the business risks Top Glove faces include fluctuations in raw material prices, foreign exchange rates, and utility costs. In the face of competition, it cannot fully pass on these cost increases to customers. It was estimated by an analyst that Top Glove could only pass on between 50% to 80% of cost increases.

6. Top Glove chairman, Tan Sri Dr Lim Wee Chai, his wife, Puan Sri Tong Siew Bee and his brother, Lim Hooi Sin are among the company’s board of directors. The chairman’s son is also part of the senior management. They collectively own a 35.8% stake in Top Glove as of October 2019. It is good to see the founder and management having some ‘skin in the game’ as this aligns them with shareholder interests.

7. Top Glove relies on a two-pronged approach to grow — organic and inorganic growth. In terms of organic growth, its annual manufacturing capacity rose massively from 3.2 billion pieces in 2001 to 64 billion pieces in 2019. For inorganic growth, Top Glove has looked at mergers and acquisitions as well as ventures into related industries ranging from rubber plantations to medical catheters, which the chairman thinks ‘is not rocket science’. The chairman views a company of Top Glove’s size needs to diversify in order to grow further.

8. Top Glove set aside RM30 million to invest in a new condom manufacturing factory to produce OEM and own brand condoms. The rationale for the investment is its attractive profit margins and valuations. In the chairman’s opinion, the condom industry also uses similar raw materials, production processes, and marketing strategies as the glove industry. Top Glove aims to grab a 5% share of the global condom market but will face hurdles as evidenced by Karex Berhad‘s — the world’s largest condom producer with 15% of global market share — recent challenges in condom supply overcapacity and government funding cuts.

9. In April 2018,  Top Glove acquired Aspion Sdn Bhd from Adventa Capital Pte Ltd for a total of RM1.4 billion. Of which, RM1.2 billion was settled via a combination of internally generated cash and loans, while the rest was satisfied via a rights issue. Three months later, Top Glove discovered irregularities in Aspion’s balance sheet and claimed that the inventory, plant, and machinery as well as acquisition price were overstated by RM74.4 million and RM640.5 million respectively. As a result, Top Glove sued Adventa Capital and its directors, Low Chin Guan and Wong Chin Toh, for RM714.9 million. Litigation is still ongoing as of December 2019. After the news, Top Glove lost RM3.8 billion or 24.6% of its market capitalisation in one day. An extraordinary general meeting was subsequently held to remove Low from the board of Top Glove. The chairman said Top Glove would be more careful with its future mergers and acquisitions but not be deterred from making additional acquisitions to fuel its growth agenda. In my opinion, Top Glove needs to improve its capital allocation and due diligence in order to preserve shareholder value.

10. Top Glove ended up 2019 in a net debt position of RM2.3 billion. It took on debt to acquire Aspion and fund its ongoing expansions. Its total-debt-to-equity ratio stood at 0.95 as at 31 December 2019. The chairman has stated that Top Glove can still continue to acquire other companies as long as the gearing is below 1.0. A ratio below 0.5 may be more ideal for more conservative investors.

11. Revenue has grown at a CAGR of 21.8% over the past 19 years. In 2019, revenue grew by 13.8% year-on-year because of robust sales growth of nitrile gloves. Revenue has increased every single year except for 2011, 2o13, and 2014. In 2011, the U.S. dollar weakened against the Malaysian ringgit, which impacted Top Glove’s revenue which is reported in U.S. dollars. Top Glove was affected by higher raw material costs the same year. In 2013-2014, the average selling price of gloves fell due to heightened competition which affected revenue.
 
  12. Net profit excluding one-off items is slightly choppy over the same period but increased at a CAGR of 18.2%. In 2019, net profit dropped 16.2% year-on-year because of higher rubber prices, competition, and losses in the vinyl segment. The drop in net profit in 2011, 2013, and 2014 was due to the same reasons mentioned above. Higher raw material prices also impacted Top Glove negatively in 2017. It has good quality earnings as its cash-flow-to-net-income ratio is at 1.2 over the past 19 years. Its ROE has averaged at 16.3%, which is above the benchmark of 15.0% we normally look for.
 
  13. Top Glove has the second highest EBITDA margin and the third highest EBIT margin among Malaysian glove manufacturers. The top four companies in the table below are sometimes collectively known as the Big Four by the media. (Malaysia is the largest glove exporter and producer with 63% market share in 2018.)
      Hartalega 22.9% 19.4%
Top Glove 13.5% 9.5%
Kossan Rubber 13.2% 9.6%
Supermax 11.4% 8.5%
Comfort 12.0% 9.0%
Careplus 8.4% 2.2%
Rubberex 15.2% 9.4%
      14. Overall, dividend per share has been on an upward trend, which is good news for income investors. Top Glove has a dividend policy of distributing not less than 50% of its net profit to shareholders each year.
 
    WHICH GLOVES ARE BETTER NITRILE OR LATEX?
  - Nitrile has a higher puncture resistance than any other glove material.
- Nitrile also has a better chemical resistance than Latex or Vinyl gloves.
- Latex gloves are the most commonly used disposable gloves because they have been the only strong disposable glove material option on the market.
     
 
Good luck and stay tuned!

Only the rubber sectors will have a big jump and bright prospect for now!

On PER basis, it is trading at an unwarranted 50% discount compared to the historical 30% to its bigger market capitalized peers. We also raise our FY21E net profit by 8% and roll forward our valuation from CY20E to CY21E. Hence, TP is raised from RM2.00 to RM2.50 based on 21x CY21E EPS (at +1.5SD above 5- year historical forward mean). Reiterate OP.
Higher volume sales and ASP; longer delivery lead times. Longer delivery lead times are indicating that demand will outstrip supply at least over the medium-term. The initial Movement Control Order (MCO)-led supply chain hiccups have been resolved with the group’s production running at 100%. Additionally, industry is raising ASPs by 3-5% or between USD0.30 to USD0.50 per thousand pieces which is not excessive per unit cost due to incremental cost. We believe SUPERMX will benefit from the robust demand which has led to longer industry delivery lead times (the moment order was placed to delivery) which has risen to an average of between 80 to 100 days as compared to 40 to 50 days normally. Signs of demand outstripping supply could potentially lead to higher ASPs. Looking at the stable raw material prices, ceteris paribus, hikes in ASPs are expected to lead to margins expansion.
Acquired two pieces of land over the past 12 months. Looking ahead, growth beyond FY21 is underpinned by capacity expansion via two land acquisitions. SUPERMX recently acquired a piece of industrial land for RM20m measuring 4.1 acres while back in July 2019 the group had acquired a piece of land measuring 16.1 acres for RM65m. Both lands are adjacent to its current Maxter Plant in Klang the merged and enlarged land tract and subsequent expanded facility within the vicinity of its Maxter Plant should yield operational synergies and greater economies of scale. The 16.1 acres land is earmarked for plant 13,14 and 15 with an estimated capacity of 4.4b pieces for each plant over the next few years. The 4.1 acres land is slated for one plant with an estimated capacity of 4.7b pieces per annum.
Outlook. Plant 12 consists of Block A and Block B, each consisting of 8 double former lines with 2.2b pieces each (total 4.4b pieces). As of now, for Block A, its remaining 3 lines started commissioning in end March 2020 on top of the 5 lines already in commercial production. For Block B, all 8 lines are expected to be fully commissioned by 2H 2020. Upon full commercial production by 2H 2020, installed capacity will rise 13.4% to 26.2b pieces per annum.
Raised FY21E net profit by 8% after raising utilisation rate from 70% to 79%. We keep our FY20E earning unchanged as we have sufficiently factored the growth into our earnings model.
Unwarranted 50% PER discount valuation to the big market capitalization peers. Reiterate OP. We roll forward our valuation from CY20E to CY21E. Coupled with the earnings upgrade, our TP is raised from RM2.00 to RM2.50 based 21x CY21 EPS of 11.8 sen (at +1.5SD above 5-year historical forward mean) from 20x previously. We like Supermax because the stock is trading at an unjustified 50% discount to bigger peers’ average valuation compared to a historical discount of 30%. We highlight again that the 50% valuation discount to bigger cap peers appears conservative.
Key risk to our call is longer-than-expected commercial operations of new plants.

topglove,"Mon, 20 Apr 2020, 9:07 AM",Economics & Strategy - On to Round 3 - HLBank Research Highlights | I3investor,https://klse.i3investor.com/blogs/hleresearch/2020-04-20-story-h1506045462-Economics_Strategy_On_to_Round_3.jsp,"The MCO has been extended by another 2 weeks (15-28 Apr) but selected sectors will be allowed “restricted operations” (within our coverage, this broadly includes aerospace, auto, machines & equipment, construction (IBS), O&G and optical). We cut 2020 GDP from -2.0% to -4.0% and maintain our view for another -50bps OPR cut this year to 2.0%. Despite the KLCI rebounding 11% from its recent low, we still expect a W-shaped trajectory to play out, bottoming around 1,000 before closing in on our year-end target of 1,350.
NEWSBREAK
On Fri, PM Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin announced that the MCO will be extended another round (15-28 Apr). He shared that the Covid-19 situation in Malaysia is still under control: (i) positive cases at 7%, below WHO’s benchmark of 10%, (ii) death rate of 1.6% vs 5.8% globally and (iii) 43% of cases have recovered. Despite so, the PM said that the war on Covid-19 is far from over. To soften the negative ramifications of the MCO on the economy, several selected sectors would be allowed to resume operations in stages under strict guidelines (discussed below). MITI has reviewed the additional sectors based on the following considerations: (i) importance in the global value chain and the country's exports to ensure the stability of export activities, (ii) those with high value-added multiplier, (iii) impact on the sustainability of SMEs in the economic sector, particularly in manufacturing and services and (iv) size of workforce involved.
HLIB’s VIEW
Not surprising. This decision marks the 2nd extension to the MCO which began on 18 Mar and was previously supposed to end on 14 Apr. The extension is unsurprising as new daily cases since the MCO started continued to exceed 100; we reckon that a greater degree of relaxation will only happen when it sustainably falls below 50. Still, there are some encouraging signs; since the near peak on 3 Apr (we predicted the peak to be on 4 Apr), new cases have shown some decreasing signs. We reckon Malaysia’s Covid-19 situation will possibly subside to contained levels sometime in May (1st or 2nd week).
Lowering 2020 GDP to -4.0%. Following the MCO extension, we downgrade our 2020 GDP forecast to -4% (previous: -2%). This is premised on the assumption that there will be very limited reopening of economic activity from 40-45% to 50-55% of GDP over a very gradual pace. The opening of more economic sectors may be in response to Federation of Malaysian Manufacturers (FMM)’s plea to allow essential product manufacturers to operate at 100% capacity and non-essential at 50%. They also shared that in a recent FMM survey involving 1,120 respondents, revealed that only 71% of them can withstand up to 4-weeks of non-operation. We expect GDP to experience a trough in 2Q20 due to expected peak of infections and gradually improve towards the end of 2020. We maintain our expectation for BNM to reduce the OPR by -50bps in 2020.
Breathing space for some. Despite the “restricted operations” accorded to some sectors, the impact of the MCO still remains widespread. Within our coverage, sectors that are allowed to resume operations under strict guidelines include:
Aerospace: DRB via CTRM and UMW via UMW Aerospace.
Automotive: Limited to exports of CBU (Mazda; BAuto) and equipment and components (Pecca).
Machines & equipment: This seems rather broad but could likely encompass tech related companies (names like UWC and Vitrox have been operating at sub optimal levels since MCO day-1) and EMS (understand that VSI will soon recommence limited operations).
Construction: Listed contactors do not fall under the G1-G2 category (paid up capital <RM25k) which has been allowed to operate. Buildings with IBS score of >70 can recommence works; positive for IBS players like Kimlun. Jobs that are >90% complete can also proceed, offering a mild reprieve to contractor’s orderbook execution.
Services related to science, professional and technical: O&G is one of the 4 areas that falls under this category but no further details provided.
Shops involved in hardware, E&E and optical: Think FocusP.
Others: Social health services, barber shops and full-service laundry.
W-shaped trajectory. Since its low of 1,220 (19 Mar), the KLCI has rebounded by 11.3%. With this “Covid-19 recession” likely to be worse than the GFC (but not as bad as AFC, hopefully), we reckon that this reprieve will be short-lived; past bear markets have all seen a “dead cat bounce” ranging 10-13%. We continue to envisage a W shaped trajectory for the market and our bottom estimates for the KLCI ranges 1,089 to 1,029 (see our 2Q20 Outlook dated 31 Mar); we would only turn buyers closer to those levels. Possible triggers to those levels include: (i) another MCO extension beyond 28 Apr, (ii) May reporting season with weaker-than-expected corporate results and 1Q20 GDP (vs BNM’s 2020 range of -2.0% to +0.5%), and (iii) risk of US-China trade war reescalation, noting the less than cordial statements by President Trump on China.
Year-end target of 1,350. Continuing from our W-shaped trajectory expectations, we maintain our 2020 KLCI year-end target at 1,350. This is based on 14.6x PE (GFC mean) pegged to mid-2021 EPS. No changes to top picks.

Amplifying the growth is restocking activities reinforced by the pandemic with longer delivery lead times indicating that demand will outstrip supply at least over the medium-term. We believe further re-rating is imminent due to its growing market share with Malaysia accounting for 65% globally. The stock has risen 55% since our upgrade in April 2019. Raised FY21E/FY22E net profit by 2%/12% after taking into account higher utilisation rate. TP is raised from RM8.00 to RM9.30 based on 49.5x CY21E EPS. Reiterate OP.
Expect a softer sequential 4QFY20 but solid YoY growth. Signs of pent-up demand for nitrile gloves, most probably on re-stocking activities surmised from industry longer delivery lead times, are pointing towards a better sequential quarter in 4QFY20. For illustration purposes, taking the cue from 3QFY20 net profit of RM121m, due to the shorter working month in February and only partial commercial production from two lines in Plant 6, we forecast 4QFY20 core PATAMI of between RM123m and RM125m (+1-+3% QoQ; +35%-+37% YoY) bringing FY20E PATAMI to between RM442m and RM444m or 91%- 98% of our/consensus forecasts which is below our expectation. Nevertheless, we are expecting better performance in subsequent quarters on the back of an uptick in demand. Note that QoQ, its 2QFY20 and 3QFY20 volume grew 14% and 13%, respectively, against industry average of 6%, implying HART is winning market share from competitors.
Higher volume sales and ASP; longer delivery lead times. Longer delivery lead times are indicating that demand will outstrip supply at least over the medium-term. The Malaysian Rubber Glove Manufacturers Association has forecast a 20% demand growth to 230b pieces in 2020. We believe HARTALEGA will benefit from robust demand which has led to longer delivery lead times (the moment order was placed to delivery) which has risen to an average of between 80 to 100 days as compared to 40 to 50 days normally. Signs of demand outstripping supply could potentially lead to higher ASPs coupled with incremental cost and higher opex. Looking at the stable raw material prices, ceteris paribus, hikes in ASPs are expected to lead to margins expansion. From our channel check, we understand industry players generally have raised prices by 3-5%.
Outlook. The first 4 lines of Plant 6 (installed capacity of 4.7b pieces) have commenced commercial operations and the remaining 8 lines are expected to be gradually ramped up. Plant 7 is expected to be commissioned by early 2021, which will focus on small orders as well as specialty products with an installed capacity of 3.4b pieces. All in, Plant 5, 6 and 7 will add a total capacity of 12.1b pieces, raising installed capacity to 43.7b pieces per annum.
Raised FY21E/FY22E net profit by 2%/12% after imputing higher utilisation rate of 90%/90% for FY21E/FY22E to 92%/95% and EBITDA margin from 23.3% to 24.0%.
Reiterate OP. YTD, the stock is up 40% and looking at the previous upcycle when the stock rose 200%, this indicates potential further upside. TP is raised from RM8.00 to RM9.30 based on 49.5x CY21E EPS (previously 48x) (at +2.0SD above 5-year historical forward mean). We switch our valuation from FY21E to CY21E. We like HART for: (i) a solid management, (ii) constantly evolving via innovative products development, and (iii) its booming nitrile gloves segment.
Risks to our call: lower-than-expected ASPs and volume sales.

Potential sell triggers would include peak valuations (+2SD), shortening of delivery lead times and minimal infected cases. However for now, earnings should be well sustained for the next two quarters.
Top pick: Kossan.
What’s New
PPE demand spikes up to 17x higher.
The Covid-19 outbreak has driven up demand for personal protective equipment (PPE). Based on a survey of 1,600 US hospitals, released by healthcare consulting company Premier, demand for PPE has surged to between 3.3-17.0x higher than the typical burn rate for PPE equipment such as N95 masks (17.0x), face shields (8.6x), isolation gowns (5.0x) and surgical masks (3.3x). While it did not specify gloves, the Covid-19 outbreak has inadvertently resulted in a demand surge for gloves as well.
Bumper year for 2020 but post previous outbreaks, volume growth has averaged 1%.
Malaysian Rubber Glove Manufacturers Association (MARGMA) expects Malaysia 2020 industry volume to grow by 13-18%, a surge from the average 10-year growth rate of 8-10%. Our industry assumption of 15% is largely in line with overall expectations. However, in periods post the past three outbreaks (SARS: 2004, H5N1: 2008 and H1N1: 2011), y-o-y growth averaged 1%.
For now, we maintain our forecast of 7% industry growth for 2021 until we obtain greater visibility over the containment of COVID-19.
ASPs have surged against the backdrop of demand spike.
Our channel checks suggest ASPs have surged by 3-5% since March as demand has far outstripped supply. Despite China already containing the outbreak domestically, glove producers are still receiving 2x the usual orders. Supply is constrained as reflected by elevated utilisation rates (~95%) and lengthening delivery lead time to 120 days from the usual 30-60 days.
Action
Maintain MARKET WEIGHT.
There is potential further upside depending on the length of the outbreak beyond our base assumption to our healthy two-year earnings CAGR forecast of 15.2% over 2019-21. However, we maintain MARKET WEIGHT on the sector as:
sector valuations are currently trading at 29.9x, close to the +1SD to the PE mean of 30.4x,
easing of outbreak would result in an eventual oversupply, leading to a de-rating in the sector,
PE valuation differential between the glove sector to the broad market has widened from 8.0x to 15.2x,
suggesting that there is deep value in the broader market.
We think valuations should be well sustained over the next two quarters; however the aforementioned factors imply that the return-to-risk appears fair at this juncture. Top pick for the sector is Kossan.
Vaccine discovery may be too premature for profit taking.
Depending on the severity of the outbreak, profit taking upon discovery of vaccine may be too premature. During H1N1, valuations continued to climb nine months after vaccine discovery, in tandem with q-o-q profit growth. We believe a more reflective measure is potential shortening of delivery lead times and decline of infected cases as potential red flags to waning demand.
Apart from that, potential peak valuations that we have highlighted may be indicative of a sell trigger as it factors in +2SD valuations against aggressive incremental demand.
Kossan Rubber Industries (BUY / Target: RM6.22).
Maintain BUY with a target price of RM6.22. Our target price is based on a PE peg of 25x, to factor in the attractive earnings growth (2-year earnings CAGR of 20% over 2019-21). Over time, the earnings growth coupled with consistent execution should reinvigorate Kossan’s valuations.
The potential re-rating should narrow its discount to Top Glove and Hartalega, which we think should be trading at 26.0x and 33.0x PE respectively.
Top Glove (HOLD / Target: RM6.05).
Our target price is based on a PE peg of 26.0x 2020F PE, a premium to the Big-3 PE mean of 24.0x.
While we continue to like the glove sector amid the COVID-19 outbreak, we believe Top Glove’s valuations have well priced in its near-term outlook amid an unprecedented sell-off in the broader market.
We believe Top Glove’s premium of 26.0x to the sector PE mean is fair given it is a component in the FBMKLCI Index and therefore deserving of a slight premium to the sector.
Entry price is RM5.50.
Hartalega Holdings (SELL / Target: RM5.85).
Our raised target price is based on a PE multiple of 33.0x to 2020F PE. It is a slight premium to 5-year forward mean but a premium to its peers, which have historically traded at an average of 24.0x. The premium can be justified by Hartelega’s strong operating efficiency and innovation ahead of peers.
Nevertheless, our bearish call is premised on Hartalega’s lofty valuation (42.7x CY2020 PE) which limits potential price upside. Entry price is RM5.20.
Essentials
EBITDA margins receive double thrust.
As we head into 2Q20, operating margins should improve further, aided by a slump in raw material prices. Although it is the wintering season (Feb – May), we expect latex prices to decline given latex demand softness (30% of demand is derived from rubber tires). Prices are currently 7% lower vs 4Q19’s average while February nitrile prices were 6% lower and are expected to fade further as it is a crude oil by-product.
Furthermore, the ramp-up in utilisation rates to ~95% from ~85% should realise enhanced economies of scale. Apart from that, should the US$/RM forex rate strengthen by 1% from our US$4.30/RM assumption, it could translate into +2% in earnings.
For FY20, we expect industry core margins to grow by 1.8bps to 12.7%, given the uptrending ASPs and favourable raw material prices. This is underlined by our base assumption of two quarters of super-normal profit backed by the surge in demand tied to the COVID-19 outbreak.
Upside of 13% and 25% to FY20 earnings forecast should outbreak be extended to 3Q and 4Q respectively.
With our base assumption of a severe outbreak over two quarters, it underlines our FY20 industry earnings growth of 25% and 6% for FY20 and FY21 respectively. We have projected flattish earnings growth for FY21 as we expect margins and volume to normalise, following high inventory built up in FY20. Our FY20 earnings represent mild upside of 5% to consensus estimates.
That said, our FY20 earnings could be further adjusted upwards by 13% and 25% should COVID-19 see an extended breakout till 3Q20 and 4Q20 respectively.
Risk
Downside risks are spikes in raw material costs and strengthening RM.
Upside risks are roader industry, pandemic outbreaks and strengthening US$.

While this should ease the SMEs to weather the storm during the pandemic, Macquarie Equities Research (MQ Research) remains constructive on the Malaysian market although it estimated that the budget deficit would rise to 5.5%.
Event
The Prime Minister announced an added RM10bn package aimed at SMEs to mitigate the pain from Covid-19 and the mandatory control order. This brings the total value of packages announced to RM260bn with a fiscal contribution of up to RM35bn. Most importantly in MQ Research’s view, this latest package lends a helping hand to the 1m SMEs in the country with a gross domestic product (GDP) contribution of 38% (2018) and employ 66% of the workforce. This added package should mitigate the negative impact from the Covid-19 pandemic somewhat.
Impact
Wage subsidy expanded. RM7.9bn of the latest package will go towards wage support for local employees earning RM4k and below. The wage subsidy rises to as much as RM1,200/month for companies with less than 75 employees. The government will also allow companies to negotiate wages with employees during this period to ease the pain from the MCO. Companies which take the wage subsidy however are not allowed to lay off these workers for a period of 6 months.
Micro credit lines help. As pointed out by the president of the SME Association of Malaysia, on a call MQ Research hosted on 3 April, the biggest issue for micro SMEs (70% of the total SMEs) is getting access to bank loans due to limited documentation. The RM2.1bn allocated by the government towards micro loans (<RM3k) will go some ways in aiding these micro SMEs and mitigate the economic impact post-Covid from layoffs etc.
Where’s the money coming from? No mention was made as to where the government was sourcing funds for this added stimulus. However, MQ Research believes that in addition to a reallocation of resources from other projects/uses as per Budget 2020 (tabled in October 2019), the government may tap Petronas and other Government Linked Companies (GLCs). Assuming 0% GDP growth, US$30/bbl oil and the total stimulus outlay of RM35bn, MQ Research estimates the budget deficit would rise to 5.5% without added cashflows from these entities. Petronas’ cash pile stood at RM83bn as at end 2019 and was projected to contribute RM24bn in dividends in 2020 under the Budget 2020.
Outlook
MQ Research remains constructive on the Malaysian market. Valuations at 1.2x price-to-book are below global financial crisis levels (1.4x) and MQ Research sees value in the banks (CIMB, RHBBANK, PBK) and defensive such as Tenaga. Exporters i.e. gloves (TOPG, HART), PCHEM and Sime Plantations also stand out. MQ Research would look to accumulate Gamuda and ECON for the pick-up in infra activity post Covid. Malaysia Airports meanwhile is a play on a return in travel post-Covid with the added likelihood of an improved regulatory framework providing valuation upside in the medium term.

Macquarie Equities Research (MQ Research) revised its KLCI target down to 1,533 (prev 1,672) for the year end while sharing its views on the sectors performance due the recent growth downgrade.
CIMB and RHB Bank are MQ Research’s core picks while Top Glove and Hartalega are foreign currency earners, among others.
Event
BNM released its 2019 Annual Report together with its Economic and Monetary Review and Financial Stability Review documents. It has also updated its 2020 gross domestic product (GDP) growth forecast downwards to -2% to +0.5% owing to the Covid-19 pandemic and the mandatory control order (MCO). The key takeaway in MQ Research’s view is that while Covid-19 presents a significant challenge to the economy, having a potentially worse impact than the AFC on employment, the financial sector has far larger buffers to weather the storm.
Updated KLCI target. In view of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic and its impact on growth over 2020 and 2021 , MQ Research is updating its end-2020 KLCI target to 1,533 (prev 1,672) reflecting the slower earnings growth for 2020 (+2.3%) as well as a lower 2021 year end price-to-earnings ratio (PER) multiple of 16x (prev 17.5x) – similar to multiples seen in 2010, post the global financial crisis rebound (see Fig 1).
Impact
GDP downgrade. The downgrades by BNM have factored in the MCO which is currently slated to end on 14 April – largely in the hands of the Ministry of Health. Private and public consumption are expected to remain positive and support domestic demand growth of 1%. However, net exports are expected to decline 27% YoY inline with the global slowdown and reduce the current account surplus to 1-2% of GDP vs 3% in 2019. All segments except for services are now expected to post YoY declines – including construction, despite refences to increase infrastructure spending. Headline Inflation is expected to range between -1.5 to 0.5% due to weaker oil prices, while core inflation is expected to range between +0.8-1.3%.
Banking sector earnings under pressure to 2021. BNM’s outlook is broadly in-line with MQ Research’s recent earnings downgrade for the sector. MQ Research maintains -13% YoY aggregate bank earnings for FY20E, which assumes, 100bps overnight policy rate cut, -1.1% loans growth and +20% net provisions for FY20/21. In line with the earnings downgrade, MQ Research also cut gross dividend payouts. MQ Research concurs with BNM that banks have sufficient capital and liquidity buffers.
Outlook
While near term volatility is likely to remain elevated, MQ Research believes investors should use any weakness to accumulate quality and thematic names for a recovery as newsflow around the virus improves and the MCO ends (worst case end April). MQ Research sees valuations of banks in particular beginning to show value with CIMB and RHBBANK as MQ Research’s core picks. Foreign currency earners in particular gloves (TOPG, HART), plantations (SDPL), PCHEM (a play on a pick-up in global activity levels) remain a key thematic, in MQ Research’s view. Tenaga meanwhile offers defensive qualities with capital management upside. Telcos while not in MQ Research’s top picks list are a worthy defensive play as well. PBK and MISC stand out as oversold with defensive qualities too.

The FBM KLCI (-2.1%) erased all its’ previous session gains following World Bank’s move to slash Malaysia’s GDP growth to -0.1% Y.o.Y (from +4.5% Y.o.Y) for 2020. The lower liners also finished mostly lower as the FBM Small Cap and FBM ACE shed 0.3% and 2.2% respectively, while broader market closed mostly lower.
Market breadth turned negative as losers outpaced the gainers on a ratio of 523-to-355 stocks. Traded volumes, however, rose 34.5% to 4.74 bln shares as quick profit taking activities took charge.
More than two-third of the key index constituents fell, dragged down by Hong Leong Financial Group (-88.0 sen), Petronas Dagangan (-78.0 sen), Nestle (- 60.0 sen), Petronas Gas (-44.0 sen) and Hap Seng Consolidated (-42.0 sen). Significant losers on the broader market include Heineken (-68.0 sen), Fraser & Neave (-46.0 sen), Batu Kawan (-36.0 sen), Dutch Lady (-30.0 sen) and Dufu Technology (-30.0 sen).
On the other side of the trade, MPI (+23.0 sen), Metrod Holdings (+21.0 sen), Aeon Credit (+20.0 sen), Far East Holdings (+20.0 sen) and C.I. Holdings (+19.0 sen) topped the broader market gainers list. There were only a handful of gainers on the FBM KLCI, namely Sime Darby (+11.0 sen), MISC (+5.0 sen), Genting Malaysia (+2.0 sen) and Genting (+1.0 sen).
Volatility returns as Asia benchmark indices finished lower with the Nikkei diving 4.5% lower as business sentiment data points to a looming recession. The Hang Seng Index slipped 2.2%, while the Shanghai Composite declined 0.6%. Asia stockmarkets, meanwhile, finished mostly lower on Wednesday’s close.
U.S. stockmarkets started off the month on a sluggish note as the Dow sank 4.4% after U.S. President Donald Trump warned of more pain ahead in the depth of the Covid-19 crisis. Similarly, the S&P 500 tumbled 4.4% with all 11 major sectors in the red, while the Nasdaq slipped 4.4%.
Major European stockmarkets - the FTSE (-3.8%), CAC (-4.3%) and DAX (-3.9%), all took a beating after reversing their previous session gains mirroring the weakness across global markets. Market sentiment was impacted by the intensifying Covid-19 pandemic in the U.S.
The Day Ahead
Recent streak of recovery appears to have taken a pause as volatility emerged across global equities on fears over global recession following the uptick in new Covid-19 cases. Market sentiment also turned downbeat following World Bank’s move to slash Asia countries growth to account for the impact of Covid-19 pandemic. Consequently, the odds of recession now have jumped to 40% (from 25% projected at the start of the year).
With volatility returning on the table, we reckon that the downside risk prevails on the FBM KLCI that looks to drift lower after some substantial gains that trimmed its’ monthly losses in March 2020. Under the prevailing scenario, a pullback may see the local bourse to be supported at the 1,300 psychological level, followed by the 1,250 level. On the upside, the 1,360 and 1,400 levels will serve as the resistance.  Although the lower liners and broader market started off the day on a upbeat note, quick profit taking emerged throughout the day as investors book their recent gains. With market sentiment turning sluggish again, we reckon that further downside may take place as investors will adopt a wait-and-see approach for the time being.

Malaysia's Top Glove Corp Bhd, which makes one out of every five gloves in the world, needs to urgently recruit up to 700 more workers as orders in the past few weeks have doubled, the company told Reuters on Wednesday.
It has already said it would not be able to meet all of the increased demand, and its struggle to recruit workers could make the task of quickly adding production lines even more difficult.
The hiring drive has been hampered by Malaysia's month-long curbs on travel as well difficulties in flying in workers from countries such as Nepal, the company's main source of labour.
A relatively industrialised nation of 32 million, Malaysia heavily relies on labour from South Asian countries.
""We were already experiencing a shortage of workers in the beginning of the year, which has now become more serious following the implementation of Malaysia's movement control order,"" executive chairman Lim Wee Chai said.
""At the moment, due to the surge in demand, we require unskilled workers, especially to speed up the packing function and quality assurance function, so that the ready output can be shipped out quickly to our customers.""
Despite the coronavirus restrictions that will last until mid-April, the company managed to recruit some 300 people last month and has engaged staffing firms to look for workers more aggressively. It is now trying to hire more Malaysians and is conducting interviews over WhatsApp video calls.
Top Glove has 18,000 employees and 44 factories in three countries with the capacity to make 73.8 billion gloves a year, which it wants to increase given the global shortage.
An emergency stockpile of medical equipment maintained by the U.S. government has nearly run out of protective gear including masks, respirators, gloves, gowns and face shields, Reuters reported on Tuesday citing officials.
Malaysia, the world's biggest glove producer, has the highest number of coronavirus infections in Southeast Asia with 2,908 cases.

Rubber glove stocks under our coverage have performed well following our upgrade eight months ago. Despite easing off from recent peaks, they remain strong outperformers YTD, led by TOPGLOV (+36%), HARTA (+26%), KOSSAN (+23%) and SUCB (+22%). The stage is now set for a solid FY20 following three quarters of anemic quarterly earnings growth. Coming off this low base due to the lackluster demand of the past 12 months, forward earnings growth will be amplified on re-stocking activities ramp-up due to the current COVID-19 pandemic which enforces higher hygiene standards boosted by better margins from higher ASP and favourable USDMYR. Our target prices for glove stocks are based on +1.5SD to +2.0SD which is to better reflect rubber gloves players’ prospects in anticipation of restocking activities, resilient earnings and their constant evolution and progress to increase earnings. We have OUTPERFORM calls on HARTA (OP; TP: RM8.00); KOSSAN (OP; TP: RM5.90) SUPERMX (OP; TP: RM2.00) and TOPGLOV (MP; TP: RM6.50). Our Top Pick for the sector is HARTA (OP; TP: RM8.00).
PER valuation potentially hitting +2.0SD in tandem with peak earnings in coming quarters. With the lackluster demand of the past 12 months behind us, we see re-stocking activities ramp-up as the current outbreak of the Wuhan virus enforces higher hygiene standards. Our target prices for glove stocks are based on +1.5SD which is to better reflect rubber gloves players’ prospects in anticipation of restocking activities, resilient earnings and their constant evolution and progress to increase earnings. Based on historical valuation at peak earnings, rubber glove stocks namely Kossan, Hartalega and Top Glove are trading at between +1.5SD to >+2.0SD historical forward mean.
Potentially higher ASPs in anticipation of a surge in demand and moderating supply growth in the past 12 months. Signs of demand outstripping supply could potentially lead to higher ASPs. Looking at the stable raw material price, ceteris paribus, hike in ASPs is expected to lead to margins expansion. We understand that some players have raised prices in anticipation of higher demand and we also noted the current high >90% utilisation rate for nitrile-centric players which is a stark contrast compared to the lacklustre demand in 2019.
Weakening of Ringgit (RM) vs. US dollar (USD) is positive to rubber glove players. YTD, the USD had risen by 7% against the MYR (USD1 = RM4.32). Generally, a weakening Ringgit is positive for glove makers. Since sales are USD-denominated, theoretically, a depreciating ringgit against the dollar will lead to more revenue receipts for glove makers. Ceteris paribus, a 1% weakening of RM against USD will lead to an average 1-2% increase in the net profit of rubber glove players.
Parallels with the SARS and H1N1 experience? During the SARS crisis, the infection was first detected in November 2002. Between then and February 2003, there were 5 casualties and over 300 were reported to have fallen ill of SARS in Guangdong province, China. During this period in 2003, Top Glove, Supermax and Kossan Rubber’s revenues and net profits grew between 15% and 25% while HARTA was only listed in 2008. Similarly, during the H1NI period, net profit grew 10-20% for rubber gloves players under our coverage.
Stage set for a recovery in volume growth. More importantly, even before the Wuhan virus crisis sets in, there were nascent signs of a solid uptick in demand for rubber gloves in coming quarters. 4QCY19 results season indicated a positive recovery in demand with players’ volumes sales growing an average 8% across the board led by HART (13%), Kossan (8%), and TOPG (2%). From our ground checks, demand for nitrile gloves is picking up again with players’ new capacities swiftly taken up. We believe this uptick in demand is turning positive and should be reflected in players’ bottom-line in subsequent quarters.
Nitrile gloves' market share to gain further momentum with potential 30% growth. Based on our analysis, we expect nitrile gloves to continue growing and expropriating market share from latex gloves. The growth in nitrile segment is evident. For illustration purposes, going forward, assuming nitrile:latex breakdown of 80:20 (currently at 67:37) and based on estimated global demand of 324b pieces in 2020 (forecast for 2019 is 300b pieces and assuming 8% growth rate in 2020), this implies nitrile growth rate of 20% or an additional 42b pieces from switching to nitrile gloves.
Our Top Pick in the sector is HARTALEGA. We like HARTA for: (i) its “highly automated production processes” model, which is moving from ‘good’ to ‘great’ as they are head and shoulders above its peers in terms of better margins and reduction in costs, (ii) constantly evolving via innovative products development, and (iii) its nitrile gloves segment, which is booming. Our TP is RM8.00 based on 48x FY21 EPS (+2.0SD above 5-year historical forward mean).

Covid- 19 aside, low oil price (hitting fiscal, ringgit and market) and possible political uncertainty resurfacing are key headwinds for 2Q. We feel the recent rebound is a “dead cat bounce” and a W-shaped trajectory is likely with a bottom KLCI estimate of 1,089 to 1,029. Year-end KLCI target of 1,350 is based on 14.6x PE (GFC mean) tagged to mid-2021 EPS. That said, we would only turn buyers at levels closer to our KLCI bottom estimate.
The peak is nigh. Malaysia has reported a total of 2,470 Covid-19 cases as of 29 Mar. We reckon that daily new cases in Malaysia could see its peak in the 1st week of Apr and subside to more containable levels by 1st week May. This is based on studying the “bell curves” of China and to a lesser extent, Italy. However, predicting the global Covid-19 trajectory is more uncertain; while China has improved, the situation has worsened in Europe and US.
Hard to avoid the “R-word”. Given the onslaught of Covid-19, IMF predicts a global recession in 2020 to be at least as bad as the GFC (2009: -0.1% YoY), but expects a recovery in 2021. As an open economy, coupled with the MCO, Malaysia will not be spared. We have cut our 2020 GDP forecast from +2.3% to -2.0%. While the RM250bn PRIHATIN stimulus is timely, we feel this only serves to cushion the downfall but not prevent it. We project private consumption to slow significantly to +0.5% in 2020 (2019: +7.6%), mirroring GFC level (2009: +0.6%). Our 2020 inflation forecast now stands at +0.5% (from 1.7%; 2019: +0.7%). Alongside negative growth, we maintain our expectations for another -50bps OPR cut in 2020 to 2.0%.
Headwinds to persist. Currency adjusted, KLCI has fallen -21% YTD (painful, yes) but still better than ASEAN-5’s -30.8%. Without sugar coating, we believe the headwinds seen in 1Q will persist into 2Q as well. While we are hopeful for Covid-19 to reduce to containable levels in May, its impact for 2Q will still be profound as the MCO has been extended 2 weeks into Apr while global containment still seems distant. Low oil prices will hit Malaysia on several fronts: (i) budget; MoF’s -4.0% deficit target seems like a tall order, (ii) weak ringgit (81% correlation), (iii) possible cut in Petronas capex and (iv) KLCI tends to have a higher correlation to oil price when the latter is falling. Lastly, while domestic politics has quieted, uncertainty could still resurface once Parliament reconvenes on 18 May.
W-shaped trajectory? Since its recent low of 1,220 (19 Mar), KLCI has rebounded by as much as 10% (27 Mar). Past bear markets have shown that it is not uncommon to see a “dead cat bounce” with magnitudes ranging 10-13%. We are inclined to believe the market will have a W-shaped trajectory and we are probably now at the first half of that W. Based on the GFC experience, our guesstimate of the KLCI’s bottom ranges from 1,089 to 1,029.
Maintain KLCI target of 1,350. We now forecast KLCI earnings to contract for the 3rd consecutive year in 2020 by -3.9% but rebound +7.7% in 2021 (recovery amid a low base). Our year-end KLCI target of 1,350 is based on 14.6x PE (2008-2009 GFC mean) tagged to mid-2021 EPS (reflecting both Covid-19 and eventual recovery). That said, we would only turn buyers at levels closer to our KLCI bottom estimate. Our top picks are those that have a relatively more resilient business nature/ strong balance sheet to weather the storm (Tenaga, Sunway, TIME, KPJ, Axis and MBM), high divvy yielders with reasonable certainty (BAT, HSI) and beneficiaries from Covid- 19: Top Glove (direct) and Bursa (circumstantial).

US: Consumer sentiment drops much more than initially estimated in March. Consumer sentiment in the US deteriorated by much more than initially estimated in March, according to revised data released by the University of Michigan. The report said the consumer sentiment index for March was downwardly revised to 89.1 from the preliminary reading of 95.9. The consumer sentiment index is now down sharply from the final February reading of 101.0, reflecting the fourth largest one-month decline in nearly a half century. An economist noted the steepest monthly drop was the 12.7-point nosedive seen in response to the deepening recession in October 2008. He said there were also two 12.2-point slumps in response to the 1980 recession and Hurricane Katrina in September 2005. (RTT)
US: Personal income climbs more than expected in February. The Commerce Department released a report showing personal income in the US increased more than expected in February, while personal spending rose in line with economist estimates. The report said personal income climbed by 0.6% in February, matching the increase seen in January. Economists had expected income to rise by 0.4%. Disposable personal income, or personal income less personal current taxes, increased by 0.5%, while real disposable income, which is adjusted to remove price changes, rose by 0.4%. Meanwhile, the Commerce Department said personal spending edged up by 0.2% for the second straight month, matching expectations. Excluding price changes, personal spending inched up by just 0.1% for the third consecutive month. ""The rise in spending last month was arguably weaker than it looks given that it was largely driven by a weather-related jump in utilities spending, with underlying goods spending little changed,"" said Andrew Hunter, Senior U.S. Economist at Capital Economics.

EU: ECB tells banks to skip payouts as virus hits economy. The European Central Bank told EU banks to skip dividend payments and share buybacks until October at the earliest, and use their profits to support the economy, as it is hit by the coronavirus pandemic. With large parts of the EU in lockdown and the economy braced for an unprecedented contraction, most banks have acknowledged they would struggle to pay a dividend for this year. But many large lenders, including Spain's Santander and Italian duo Intesa Sanpaolo and UniCredit were still clinging to plans for paying out part of last year's profits. ""To boost banks’ capacity to absorb losses and support lending...they should not pay dividends for the financial years 2019 and 2020 until at least 1 October 2020,"" the ECB said. ""Banks should also refrain from share buy-backs aimed at remunerating shareholders."" (Reuters)
UK: BoE warns of long term damage to economy. The Bank of England has warned there are mounting risks of widespread job losses and companies going out of business across Britain as the economic costs of the coronavirus outbreak become more apparent. Leaving interest rates on hold at the lowest levels in its 325-year history, the Bank said long-term damage to employment and growth was likely as the government steps up its efforts to contain the disease. Threadneedle Street has already cut interest rates twice this month to 0.1% and pumped more than GBP200bn into the economy through its quantitative easing programme, in an effort to ease borrowing costs for households and businesses and to calm panicked investors. In a reflection of the scale of the crisis, the central bank’s rate-setting monetary policy committee declared after its scheduled meeting that it “stands ready to respond further as necessary to guard against an unwarranted tightening in financial conditions, and support the economy”.

China: Industrial firms post steepest fall in profits in a decade. Profits at China’s industrial firms slumped in the first two months of the year to their lowest in at least a decade, with the mining, manufacturing and power sectors all seeing sharp falls, as a virus epidemic battered China’s economy. Profits earned by Chinese industrial firms in the first two months dropped 38.3% YoY to CNY410.7bn, worsening from a 6.3% fall seen in December last year, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data showed. It marked the steepest decline in data going back to 2010. The reading combines the results for January and February to exclude distortions caused by the week-long Lunar New Year. (Reuters)
India: Cuts key rates unexpectedly to mitigate Covid-19 economic impact. India's central bank reduced its key interest rate unexpectedly and unveiled measures to improve liquidity to combat the economic downturn caused by the spread of coronovirus and preserve financial stability. The Monetary Policy Committee of the Reserve Bank of India voted to cut the repo rate by 75bps to 4.40%, Governor Shaktikanta Das said. Accordingly, the marginal standing facility, or MSF rate and the Bank Rate were reduced to 4.65% from 5.40%. Further, widening the liquidity adjustment facility corridor, the central bank trimmed the reverse repo rate by 90bps to 4.00%. The purpose of adjusting the corridor was to make it relatively unattractive for banks to park funds with the RBI and instead, use these funds for productive sectors, the governor said. (RTT)
India: To miss sugar export target as lockdown roils ports, mills. Sugar mills in India, the world’s third-biggest shipper, will probably miss their export target this year as a nationwide lockdown to prevent the spread of the coronavirus disrupts logistics at ports. The country won’t be able to ship 5m tons in the year to September, as expected earlier, because of a shortage of labor at ports and mills, said Adhir Jha, MD and CEO of Indian Sugar Exim Corp. India, struggling with record stockpiles, is seeking to boost sales of raw sugar to countries such as Indonesia and Malaysia to reduce a domestic glut. Any disruption in supplies could support global prices. Though Indian ports are exempted from the lockdown, many workers are grappling with transport problems and have left for their hometowns.

The company has extended shipping times to cope with the demand surge, Executive Chairman Lim Wee Chai told Reuters by phone on Friday.
Lim said orders received in the past few weeks, mainly from Europe and the United States, were almost double the company’s production capacity. Top Glove can produce 200 million natural and synthetic rubber gloves a day.
There are now more than 600,000 coronavirus cases across 202 countries and territories globally, with the United States overtaking China as the country with the most infections. Europe continues to report the most deaths.
“Some customers panic order; normally they order 10 containers a month but now they suddenly increase to 20 containers,” he said.
The World Health Organisation warned on Friday that the ""chronic global shortage of personal protective gear"" is among the most urgent threats to the virus containment efforts.
“Definitely there is a shortage. They order 100% more, we can only increase 20% so there is a shortage of about 50% to 80%,” he said.
The exceptional buying momentum could last another three months but orders are expected to remain strong for up to nine months even as demand from Asian markets has started to slow slightly, Lim said.
To cope, the company has adjusted its delivery time from as short as 30 days to as long as 150 days.
Lim said the company was ensuring all its customers get a fair share of extra gloves delivered.
“We manage their volume, limit them to buy so much per customer. We have to manage but it's a good problem for us to solve,” he said.
Lim said the company is adding new machines every week, and could increase its production by as much as 30%.
This month, Top Glove stepped up its factory utilisation by 10% to 95% and expects to reach near maximum utilisation in April.
The company is rushing to source about 1,000 workers to keep up. Top Glove normally hires from Nepal but is now drafting workers from Malaysia because of travel restrictions.
“We need about 10% extra workers. During this (travel curbs), we are also not able to bring in workers from Nepal. So we have no choice, we have to use some local workers to help out, in the packing especially.”
Top Glove said its supply chain is well-diversified and was optimistic it would not have issues sourcing materials in the next few weeks. Malaysia has approved some manufacturers in the essential goods sectors to continue operating under specific conditions during the nation's lockdown that ends on April 14.

Robust demand from developed nations. We participated TopGlove’ analyst and fund manager conference call briefing yesterday and felt optimistic on its coming quarters’ prospects. We were told that there is a very strong demand from certain countries namely, Italy, Australia, and the United States due to explosive coronavirus outbreak within these countries. Demands from China, South Korea, Singapore and Hong Kong had been strong before the current outbreak in western regions. According to the management, the Group will fulfill the orders based on the severity of COVID-19 cases instead of hoarding practice from other orders.
Higher ASP expected. The Group will increase the average selling price (ASP) of gloves by 3 to 5% on the back of huge demand orders. Operational wise, the management saw mild business interruption from movement control order (MCO) as well as labour shortage.
Plants are running smoothly. The Group is currently running hard to fulfil the global demand on gloves with almost full capacity (>95%) utilization rate of existing plants. There is no supply disruption for TopGlove during MCO and the Group’s other operation arms remain intact with the aid of internet technology although part of its staff are work from home. Notably, the production lines are currently operating 24-hours with 2 shifts.
Comments
Looking for commendable profit margins. TopGlove has guided 20–40% net profit margin increase from 1HFY2020 for the following 2 quarters of the financial year amid low material prices for butadiene, nitrile latex, and natural rubber. The demand for raw material prices will go down amid low demands from automakers in Asia because of closure of plants. We expect the Group returns to double-digit net profit margin for FY2020F from single-digit profit margin recorded in 1HFY2020.
Reversing trend on certain regions. The demand from North America is expected to come back from a negative growth (-8.4%) in 2QFY2020 although it had been stocking up before the outbreak. We believe the leap and bound cases of COVID-19 in the US will boost TopGlove’s orders even with sufficient inventory imported in beginning of CY2020.
Postponement of Olympic 2020. The Group has received heavy demand from Japan for preparing this grand sport event. However, the postponement of Olympic 2020 to CY2021 defers some of the orders. Nevertheless, we believe the demand will resume in CY2021 as the country is one of the highest gloves usage per person in the world.
Earnings Outlook/Revision
We revise upward our FY20F earnings forecasts by +16.7% to RM569.1m from RM487.6m on the expectation of sustainable strong demand for gloves in the next few months and weakening of MYR against USD.
Valuation & Recommendation
Maintain BUY with a higher target price of RM7.60 (previous target price of RM6.50) after our earnings upgrade. Our revised target price is now pegged at 34x FY20F PER, which is at +1 standard deviation 5-year historical mean PE on the back of brighter outlook in respect of resilient glove demand.

Given the current situation, we expect Top Glove to deliver stellar results in the coming quarters as they have increased ASP due to higher demand. Additionally, lower raw material cost, weaker Ringgit as well as better operating efficiency should also lead to stronger earnings. All in, we expect margins to expand going forward. We maintain our Outperform call, with a TP of RM8.60.
Gaining from the pandemic. While the Covid-19 outbreak was initially concentrated in Asia, the center of pandemic has now shifted to Europe, as declared by WHO. This signifies that the demand will also shift from latex gloves to nitrile glove and Top Glove was able to benefit from both as it has a good mix of nitrile and latex gloves. Thus far, the order visibility has reached till August, which is way ahead of its usual 3 months’ order backlog. Top Glove projects the total sales volume to grow by c.16% QoQ in 3QFY20, and the strong demand to sustain for months to come. Lead time is c.4 months currently, as opposed to the normal 1.5 months. In order to cope with the extra orders, Top Glove’s plants are now running well above 95% utilization rate. With the higher operating efficiency, weaker Ringgit, lower raw material prices and higher ASP, we expect FY20F PAT margins to expand by 1-2ppts YoY.
Shortage due to Movement Control Order (MCO)? Glove makers are allowed to continue operating during this MCO period as rubber gloves are deemed as essential medical items. MARGMA has also urged the government to authorize glove makers to operate at 100% capacity. However, we understand that Top Glove’s production floor and packaging team are currently operating at maximum capacity, while certain non-essential employees are assigned to work from home, as with other glove makers. Top Glove is also working with the Federation of Malaysian Manufacturers and MARGMA, to seek MITI’s approval for the supporting industries to operate. This includes the packaging material suppliers, chemical manufacturers and the likes, and some of these supporting entities have obtained MITI’s approval. Shipments and logistics, however, were not impacted by the MCO.
Expansion plan. Despite the MCO in Malaysia, Top Glove does not expect any delay in the commissioning of the 1st Phase of its F40 Plant (+2.7bn pcs nitrile gloves pa), which was scheduled to start operations in 2QCY20, as the Malaysian government has thus far been very supportive to the local glove makers, hence the construction works might be granted approval to carry on.

顶级手套集团主席丹斯里林伟才今日在透过电话会议的汇报会披露，从2月3日至3月23日，公司的每周手套订单增幅达163%，从11亿2000万个增长至29亿4000万个。
世界卫生组织3月12日起宣布冠病为全球大流行，该集团手套从每周11亿个正常订单，飙升118%至逾24亿4000万个，然后再走高至超过29亿个。
他说，各个国家需求视疫情紧迫性而增，比如中国在疫情高峰期增至8.1倍，减缓时则缓至2倍。澳洲在最近两周增10.5倍。
优先应付各国政府订单
他说：“这期间，我们优先应付各国政府订单，因这些订单是供给医护人员在前线‘战疫’时的防护。”
他披露为了应付殷切需求，该集团产能也从2月初的85%，提振至超过95%，24小时分两班赶货。
他说，办公室员工一半居家办公，目前担忧的是生产部份仍然缺少10%工人。
5至6月料调整售价
林伟才也说，目前原料价偏低，因此预期会在5至6月期间调整平均售价。
他预期至财政年下半年（8月杪截止），基于手套价量齐升，赚幅可扬升，来到20%至40%，相比沙斯期间为16.4%。
根据该集团资料，2009年沙斯期间净赚幅与营运赚幅介于11.0至18.8%。
提到手套供不应求的问题，林伟才说，他预期供应短缺达2至3个月，过后会恢复稳定而正常化。
基于各国疫情各有先后，即从中国而目前美欧疫情愈加严重，他预期抗疫期可能拉长到6至9个月之久。
李金谋：与政府商谈
供应中断隐忧解决
由于政府的行动管制影响，集团董事经理拿督李金谋指出，在与政府商谈后，已经解决供应恐断链的隐忧。
大马在3月18日起实施行动管制，管制初期一些供应商不获准营运。
李金谋指出，在与国际贸工部沟通后，供应商已获准恢复营运，有关化学品与用于包装的油墨周三也获准供应，克服了供应链断裂的问题。
他说，该团周四还会再与国际贸工部进一步沟通，以给予手套生产营运，作为支援前线医护人员“抗疫”的重要工业地位。
不过，该公司的包装与化学供应早前已经有准备而有库存，在短期断供应期间还持续营作。
林伟才指出，迄今供应链的供应商与政府等单位都非常支援，因此公司会应需求增长而按计划扩大产能。
基于需求殷切，林伟才说，目前也需比平时多一倍时日才能交货。
原定扩产如期进行
林伟才表示，原定产能扩展如期进行，预期2020至2021年新增150生产线和177亿个手套，到2021年杪总共有861条生产线，每年新增911亿个手套。
他说，已接手子公司Aspion私人有限公司一年半，预期占其业务10%的公司可渐入佳境，其余90%业务向好。

MQ Research summarized that the plant will likely only contribute to earnings in FY23E as construction begins in 2021. Though the movement control order (MCO) may spell some delays in Hartalega’s expansion, resulting in further shortage of gloves in the market, MQ Research maintains its Outperform rating on this glovemaker with a target price (TP) of RM7.10.
Event
Hartalega announced plans to acquire 95 acres of land for total consideration of RM263m for the next phase of expansion and is set to commission the first line by 2HCY22. Apart from this, management also indicates current market is having shortage of gloves. This is in line with MQ Research’s investment thesis, which should lead to potential average selling price (ASP) increases and margin expansion.
Impact
Acquisition details. The 95 acres of land are located at Banting, 32km away from existing Next Generation Integrated Glove Manufacturing Complex (NGC). As part of the deal, the vendor will convert the land into heavy industrial title and construct road infrastructure. This acquisition is targeted to complete by 2HCY22 and will be funded by internally-generated funds or bank borrowings. Assuming the RM263m is fully funded by bank borrowings, Hartalega’s gearing ratio raises from 10% to 20%.
Replicating NGC 1.0 model. NGC 2.0 will have seven plants, which have total 32bn pcs capacity (+74%). This will bring total capacity to 76.0bn pcs in 2029. Plant construction is targeted to begin in 2021, which is concurrent with the vendor’s construction of road infrastructure. The first plant is expected to commission in 2H22. Hence, NGC 2.0 will only start contributing to FY23 earnings.
Updates on COVID-19 impact. Management acknowledged that the market is experiencing a shortage of gloves due to the recent spike in COVID-19 infections. It also confirmed that it has been able to raise ASP to pass through higher operational costs. Hence, MQ Research reiterates its thesis on the shortages lead to margin expansion for all glove makers, including Hartalega.
Impact from MCO. Plant 6 expansion is likely to experience some delay due to the 28 days of MCO. Recap, MQ Research’s initial expectation is to add another two lines from Plant 6 in April. Each line produces 0.39bn pcs/annum (1% of total installed capacity). That aside, supply of raw material and other packaging materials is not an issue during MCO as Hartalega has sufficient inventories and overseas sources.
Action and Recommendation
MQ Research views rubber gloves as a staple within the healthcare industry, which MQ Research believes justifies the premium valuation for the sector. MQ Research reiterates an Outperform rating on Hartalega with a TP of RM7.10, which is based on +1.5 standard deviation of 43x. MQ Research’s top pick remains Top Glove (TOPG MK, RM6.11, Outperform, TP: RM7.35), which trades at 28x price-to-earnings ratio vs. Hartalega at 42x.

The share price could, however, be capped by the conversion of exchangeable bonds into new shares at RM6.10 per share. Upgrade FY20E/FY21E net profit by 9% each. TP is raised from RM5.95 to RM6.50 based on 32x CY20E EPS. Reiterate MP.
Higher volume and ASPs in 2HFY20 with production running 100%. TOPGLOV’s 2QFY20 post-results briefing highlighted that management is confident of achieving higher volume sales in 2HFY20 following the COVID-19 pandemic. Management highlighted that requests for huge volumes of gloves to the tune of 400m to 500m pieces are coming from countries including Spain, France, Italy, Germany, Saudi Arabia. Correspondingly, management is confident of mid-teens growth in volume sales since orders have been secured up till August 2020. The initial Movement Control Order (MCO)-led supply chain hiccups have normalised. The group production floor is running at 100% where 50% of workers are running operation with two shifts. Additionally, the group is raising ASPs by 3-5% or between USD0.30 to USD0.50 per thousand pieces which is not excessive per unit cost.
Longer delivery lead times. Solid industry numbers and longer delivery lead times are indicating that demand will outstrip supply at least over the medium-term. The Malaysian Rubber Glove Manufacturers Association has forecast a 20% growth to 230b pieces in 2020. TOPGLOV robust demand has led to longer delivery lead times (the moment order was placed to delivery) has risen to between 80 to 100 days as compared to 40 to 50 days (3 months ago).
Subsequent quarters’ earnings to be driven by higher volume sales, ASPs and strengthening USD vs MYR. Initially in the early stage of the virus outbreak, sales orders came mainly from China, Hong Kong, Singapore and South Korea. TOPGLOV has in recent weeks also received strong orders from Europe, US and other countries. With current utilisation levels at >90%, the group is able to further ramp up production close to 100%, to meet the surge in demand. It has new capacity coming on-stream with F2B and F5A having commenced operations, which will add 3.2bn pieces of gloves per annum. Ceteris paribus, each 1% increase in volume sales and ASP will raise our FY20E and FY21E net profit by 1% and 1.2%, respectively.
Capacity expansion include: Factory 7A (operational by end-1Q 2020; 0.4bn pieces), Factory 2B (operational by 1Q 2020; 0.7b pieces), Factory 5A (operational by 1Q 2020; 2.5b pieces), Factory 40 (Phase 1 operational by 2Q 2020 and Phase 2 operational by 3Q 2020; 2.7b and 2.0b pieces), Factory F41 (2Q 2020; 4b pieces) and Factory 8A (by 4Q 2020; 3.5b pieces) to boost the group’s production capacity in 2020 by 11.8b gloves per annum to 81.9b (+17%).
Raised FY20E/FY21E net profit by 9%/9% after taking into account higher growth for volume sales from 12%/13% to 15%/16% and PBT margin from 9% to 11%.
Reiterate MP. TP is raised from RM5.95 to RM6.50 based on unchanged 32x CY20E EPS of 20.3 sen (at +1.5SD above 5-year historical forward mean). The share price could be capped by the conversion of exchangeable bonds. Recall, back in 2019, Top Glove issued USD200m in convertible bonds as part of their debt restructuring. The bonds can be converted into new shares at RM6.10 per share.
A key upside risk to our call is better-than-expected volume sales and margin.

We maintain our HOLD call on Top Glove Corporation (Top Glove) with an unchanged FV of RM6.28/share. Our valuation is based on 33x FY21F EPS.
We continue to like Top Glove for its: (1) expansionary plans; (2) focus and continual efforts in improving quality and operational efficiencies; and (3) position as the world’s largest rubber glove manufacturer. However, as its share price has rallied over 33% YTD and it is currently trading at around 33x FY21F PE, we believe that the stock is fairly valued.
We forecast Top Glove’s revenue and net profit to grow by 12% and 44% YoY respectively in FY20F underpinned by increased demand as the Covid-19 outbreak escalates. Top Glove’s production capacity is also expected to expand by 16% YoY to 81.6bil in FY20F. According to the company, its expansion plans remain and are minimally impacted by the movement control order (MCO).
However, assuming the Covid-19 outbreak is contained within FY20F, we anticipate a slower sales growth in FY21F due to an excess supply of inventory. We forecast Top Glove’s net profit to contract by 8% in FY21F.
In the 2QFY20 briefing conference call yesterday, Top Glove said that it is expecting demand to grow 16% QoQ in 3QFY20 as the Covid-19 outbreak escalates. As shown in Exhibits 1–3, Top Glove is estimating sales volume growth of 15% QoQ for latex gloves, 20% QoQ for nitrile gloves and flattish sales of vinyl gloves.
Average selling price (ASP) is expected to grow 3.5% per month in April–June despite declining raw material prices and a weaker MYR against the USD.
The group expects its net profit margin to expand by 20– 40% in 2HFY20 on the back of easing raw material prices, higher USD vs. the MYR, and higher utilization rate and ASP from increased demand in light of the Covid-19 pandemic. The pandemic has caused a shortage of supply as demand soars, exceeding available supply.
Top Glove’s manufacturing plants are operating as normal as the glove manufacturing industry is one of MITI’s list of essential supply industries. However, the group’s office workers are split into two teams, alternating between work from home and office.
Top Glove said that there have been some disruptions in the supply of packaging and chemicals as there are many suppliers that have not gained approval to operate during the MCO yet. Furthermore, suppliers that gained approval are only operating at 50% workforce level.

Top Glove production lines are uninterrupted during the MCO period as gloves are considered an essential healthcare product, with production lines running at 100%. Stronger demand in 3QFY20 is expected due to Covid-19 outbreak along with improved profitability through higher utilization. We adjust our FY20-22 forecast upwards by +4.6%, +1.1% and +1.4% after factoring in higher utilisation due to Covid-19 and expansion of capacity. Maintain BUY with higher TP of RM7.40 (from RM6.76), as we roll forward our valuation to mid-FY21 earnings pegged to PE multiple of 35x (+1.5SD above mean).
Recap. 1HFY20 revenue stable at RM2.4bn (+0.7% YoY) thanks to sustained volumes (+0.6% YoY), followed by an increase in core PATMI to RM231.3m (+10.1% YoY) due to EIs and lower tax (effective tax rate of 11% vs. 1HFY19: 18%).
Growth in coming quarters. During the SARS outbreak (2003), global demand for gloves showed an increase of c.15.5% while during H1N1 (2009-2010), it increased to c.16%. While Top Glove has not seen a significant increase from Covid-19 in 2QFY20, we expect this to be evident in the coming quarters. As at 2QFY20, utilisation rate is at 86%, and as we understand, the current utilisation rate is more than 95%. This is to ensure all orders are being met specially to combat Covid-19. Currently we understand that Top Glove’s production lines are not affected with the Movement Control Order (MCO) which has extended to 14th April 2020, as gloves are considered an essential healthcare product. Production is running at 100%, as we comprehend the company recently received an exemption to fully staff its production lines. What more, Top Glove is the largest manufacturer in the world, commanding 26% of global market share. Stronger demand in 3QFY20 is expected due to Covid-19 outbreak along with improved profitability through higher utilization.
ASP. YoY, ASP was flattish (-0.1%) due to mixed prices, increased for latex, vinyl and surgical gloves but decline in nitrile gloves. With the expected overwhelming demand for gloves, we expect ASP to exhibit upward pressure as distributors compete for orders.
CSR. Top Glove has donated 3m pieces of gloves to China as part of an initiative by the Malaysian government and Malaysian glovemakers earlier in January 2020. For Malaysian usage, Top Glove is currently committed to donate 2.5m pieces of medical gloves to aid in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic to various parties; MOH, PDRM, MARGMA, NGOs as well as RM500k cash contribution to MOH.
Outlook. We expect stronger 2HFY20 in view of the ongoing Covid-19 outbreak. The epicentre has moved from China to Europe, whilst cases started to spike in the USA. Thus, demand growth is expected to exceed the traditional 8-10% per annum. Top Glove’s expansion plans are still going as planned, with no expected delays. In 2020, it will add c.8.2bn pieces in capacity (+16.4% YoY). By 2021, it is projected to have 39 factories with 861 production lines (+11.6% YoY).
Forecast. We increase FY20-22 forecast by +4.6%, +1.1% and +1.4% after raising utilisation assumptions to 85% due to Covid-19 outbreak and capacity expansion.
Maintain BUY, with a higher TP of RM7.40 (from RM6.76) as we roll forward our valuation to mid-FY21 EPS, pegged to PE multiple of 35x (+1.5SD above mean). Top Glove is a good hedge against the broader market negatives from Covid-19 and weak ringgit.

Management also provided some optimistic guidance for both sales volume and ASP, which are tracking slightly ahead of our expectations. We raise our 12-month TP to RM7.70 and reaffirm our BUY call.
Expecting a Strong 2HFY20
Management is expecting TOPG’s sales volume to increase by 16% qoq to 15.8bn pcs in 3QFY20, as it has already secured the required orders until 4QFY20. To meet the demand, TOPG had increased the production utilisation rate to 90% from 85% from the start of 2020, and is working towards a 100% utilisation rate. However, we believe that the goal in not achievable for now, due to the movement control order which only allows 50% of its workforce to operate, as the restriction limits the total number of people allowed in the factory. Although there are also some disruptions in the current supply chain, management believes it is still manageable.
Price Increase Is Unavoidable
Management also provided some indication on the ASP trend for 2HFY20. Apart from the price increase implemented in Feb, TOPG is planning to increase the ASP by a further 3-5% per month over the next 3 months. This is significantly higher than our expectations, as we had only factored in a 5-10% ASP hike for 2HFY20. Due to the glove shortage, governments across the world have started procuring gloves directly from manufacturers. We believe that there is more upside for margin improvement, as we expect raw material prices to fall in tandem with the oil price.
Maintain BUY Rating With Higher TP of RM7.70
We have raised our EPS for FY20-22E by 3.8-5.0% to factor in the stronger demand and higher margins as guided by management. As a result, we raised our 12-month TP to RM7.70, based on an unchanged CY20E PER of 40x. Top Glove remains one of our top BUY picks for the sector and country. Downside risks to our call would be a sharp appreciation of the Ringgit, and sharp increase in raw-material prices.

The FBM KLCI (+2.5%) staged a relief rebound to re-test the 1,300 psychological level after lingering in the positive territory for the entire trading session yesterday. The lower liners - the FBM Small Cap (+5.1%), FBM Fledgling (+2.8%) and FBM ACE (+6.0%), all rebounded, while the broader market finished higher, led by the technology sector (+7.6%).
Market breadth turned positive as gainers were on the upper hand against the losers on a ratio of 756-to-155 stocks. Traded volumes rose 13.1% to 3.17 bln shares amid the positive market sentiment.
Anchoring the FBM KLCI winners list was Hong Leong Bank (+RM1.50), followed by Public Bank (+RM1.34), Hong Leong Financial Group (+86.0 sen), KLK (+56.0 sen) and and Nestle (+40.0 sen). Notable advancers on the broader market were Fraser & Neave (+RM2.00), Dutch Lady (+RM1.90), Carlsberg (+RM1.78), Allianz (+RM1.16) and Heineken (+90.0 sen).
Notable decliners on the broader market include Shangri-La (-31.0 sen), Chin Teck Plantations (-19.0 sen), Warisan (- 19.0 sen), DKLS Holdings (-10.0 sen) and Negri Sembilan Oil Palms (-10.0 sen). In the meantime, Petronas Gas (- 36.0 sen), Malaysia Airport Holdings (- 21.0 sen), DiGi (-10.0 sen), Press Metal (-10.0 sen) and Hartalega (-8.0 sen) fell on the local bourse.
Asia benchmark indices advanced as the Nikkei jumped 7.1% following U.S. government move to allocate indefinite liquidity to support the financial markets. Likewise, the Hang Seng Index surged 4.5%, while the Shanghai Composite finished 2.3% higher. Asia stockmarkets, meanwhile, finished higher on Tuesday’s close.
U.S. stockmarkets recorded their biggest single day rally as the Dow jumped 11.4% overnight on optimism that members of Congress may reach a deal on a nearly $2 trn stimulus package. On the broader market, the S&P 500 surged 9.4% with all eleven major sectors advanced, while the Nasdaq rallied 8.1% higher.
Earlier, European stockmarkets – the FTSE (+9.1%), CAC (+8.4%) and DAX (+11.0%), all recovered their previous session losses, taking cue from gains across global equities. Market sentiment was also supported by slowing signs that the Covid-19 spread in Italy.
The Day Ahead
Yesterday’s gains on the FBM KLCI were stronger than anticipated amid the optimism over U.S. central bank’s massive stimulus move. It appears that the overnight gains may spillover to Asia equities as central banks across the globe will also step up their moves to combat the slowing economic growth, of which the Malaysian government will outline another round of measures on next Monday (30th March 2020).
Moving forward, we see the recovery continuing to allow the key index to find stability. As it is, the market undertone of global indices are showing signs of stabilisation that will also extend to Malaysian equities and potentially boost bargain hunting activities after the FBM KLCI’s bout of oversold. We see the 1,320 level the immediate target, followed by the 1,350 level. The supports, meanwhile, are at 1,250 and 1,210 levels respectively.
The lower liners and broader market shares should also be heading higher in tandem with the improved market sentiments. This could entice more retail players to undertake bargain hunting activities following the recent sharp downturn.

Flattish volume growth was tempered by high latex cost.
Top Glove has ramped up production significantly to meet the surge in demand due to the COVID-19 outbreak. This is amid better ASPs and lower raw material cost as its supply chain remains intact.
We continue to like Top Glove but its valuations appear fair in the midst of an unprecedented selloff in the broader market.
Maintain HOLD. Target: RM6.05. Entry price: RM5.50.
Results
Within expectations but outlook has improved vastly.
Top Glove’s 2QFY20 core net profit of RM116m (+4.4% q-o-q, -9.1% y-o-y) met our and consensus expectations.
Earnings accounted for 44% and 48% of our and consensus full-year estimates respectively.
Despite meeting incremental demand tied to the COVID-19 pandemic, margins were weighed by a spike in latex cost. We expect volume and margins to significantly improve going forward.
Flattish revenue as latex and nitrile saw mixed fortunes.
Revenue growth was muted q-o-q, growing 1.7% to RM1,230m in 2QFY20. While volumes for nitrile grew 2% q-o-q, ASP (+1%) was offset by weaker USD forex (-1%). Nitrile growth was constricted post restocking activities in 1QFY20 as latex gloves grew 11% q-o-q due to market share accretion.
Margins would have improved further had it not been for latex.
While ASPs were raised by 1% q-o-q, EBITDA margin only improved by 40bp to 15.8% q-o-q (1QFY20: 15.4%, 2QFY19: 15.7%). Margins improved on the back of higher utilisation and lower nitrile (-5.3% q-o-q), but these were tempered by higher latex cost (+5.8% q-o-q).
Meanwhile, Aspion’s performance improved with sales growing by 29% q-o-q.
Stock Impact
Expansion plans intact.
Top Glove’s existing production capacity stands at 73.4b gloves/p.a.. Positively, its expansion plans are unhindered by Malaysia’s COVID-19 movement-control initiatives. Over the subsequent quarters, Top Glove expects to grow its capacity by 2.7%/4.6%/4.4% incrementally q-o-q between 2Q20 to 4Q20. This effectively translates to 12.3% y-o-y growth in capacity. The additional capacity would allow Top Glove to meet a surge in demand amid the COVID-19 outbreak.
Running at full steam.
Top Glove’s supply chain remains intact during the controlled movement period as well, with Top Glove currently operating > 90% utilisation rate.
Apart from the elevated utilisation rate from the usual mid-80s (2QFY20: ~86%), we gather industry fulfilment lead time for glove producers has risen to 4 months from the usual 1-2 months. This has translated to industry ASPs surging 3-5%. In addition, latex and nitrile prices are currently trending by -1% and -1.5% respectively lower relative to 2Q20’s averages.
A lesson from history suggests valuations could be supported by surge in earnings.
Firstly, sector profit margins improved to 14.5% from 10.5% in the four quarters after and before the H1N1 outbreak respectively. The improvement in profit margin could exceed our FY20 projections of 9.3% (FY19: 7.7%).
Secondly, sector earnings enjoyed three quarters of enhanced q-o-q growth (4.9% to 10.3%) even after vaccine discovery. H1N1 persisted for 16 months, from first suspected human infection to the World Health Organisation (WHO) declaring containment.
Thirdly, valuations tracked sector earnings, not vaccine discovery. In terms of valuations, it peaked to 17.8x one-year forward PE (or > +1 SD of 16.3x) in Jul 10. Peak valuations coincided with peak sector earnings in 2Q10. However, we note that valuations were sustained past the approval of the drug vaccine as there was a gestation period for containing the H1N1 outbreak.
Earnings Revision / Risk
We upgrade our earnings forecasts by 10%/8%/5% for FY20/21/22 to account for higher ASPs, volume and US dollar assumptions.
Key upside risks include:
the US dollar appreciating markedly vs the ringgit, and
more sizeable value-accretive M&As.
Downside risks include:
swift containment of COVID-19 outbreak, and
disruption to its production or supply chain caused by the COVID-19 outbreak.
That said, Top Glove’s production is spread across 40 sites. Every +1% deviation from our US$4.30/RM, translates to ~6% to our EPS.
Valuation / Recommendation
Maintain HOLD and target price of RM6.05. While the COVID-19 breakout has resulted in a surge in demand for medical grade gloves, there has been a spike in risk-off sentiment, suggesting a higher risk premium to valuations. As such, we lower our PE peg from 28.5x 2021F PE to 26x, largely in line with the sector PE mean.
While we continue to like the glove sector amid the COVID-19 outbreak, we believe Top Glove’s valuations have well priced in its near-term outlook amid an unprecedented sell-off in the broader market.
Entry price is RM5.50.

Top Glove reported a net profit of RM116.0m in 2QFY20, up 4.1% QoQ and 8.7% YoY. Quarterly revenue stood at RM1229.7m, +1.7% QoQ and +6.6% YoY. Additionally, the group handed out an operating profit of RM149.3m which equated to 2.7% YoY growth.
Moderate 6MFY20 result. The group reported a revenue of RM2438.8m in 6MFY20 which increased marginally by 0.7% YoY. Besides, the group recorded a stagnant operating profit of RM305.1m (-4.7% YoY). As a result, net profit came at RM227.4m (+4.9% YoY).
Within our expectation and consensus. 6MFY20 net profit accounts for 49.0%/47.5% of our/consensus full year estimates.
Comments
Slightly better YoY performance. Top Glove’s revenue up 6.0% YoY due to higher average selling price of natural rubber glove (+9% YoY) as well as higher sales volume for nitrile gloves (+14% YoY). The Group’s operating profit increased 2.7% YoY because of lower nitrile latex raw material price (- 8% YoY), mild natural gas price hike (+3% YoY) and better operating efficiency from a large scale of production. Also, the group recorded marginally higher YoY net profit for its 6MFY20 to RM227.4m (+4.9%) because of lower tax expenses (- 23.7% YoY) pertaining to tax incentives. We believe the flattish of total sales volume (+1% YoY) due to fixed number of medical practitioners in our existing healthcare system globally and couldn’t be increased significantly in a short time of period. World Health Organization (WHO) estimates 76 million examination gloves needed per month.
Flattish QoQ result. The Group recorded gains of revenue (+1.7% QoQ), operating profit (+5.4% QoQ), and profit after tax (+3.8% QoQ). These were boosted by strong sales volume growth from latex powdered gloves (+16% QoQ) and surgical gloves (+18% QoQ). Also, better results from Aspion underpinned the overall bottom line in which 1HFY20 recorded 125% of FY19.
Expansion plans come at the right time. The Group has two new plants coming to serve namely F2B and F5A which will add extra 24 lines/3.2 billion capacity to the existing production lines. Aggregately, the current 711 production lines/73.4 billion of production believe to be able to cater the strong demand from America and Eurozone where the places in COVID-19 outbreaks.
Higher equity base. The Group issued a RM1.3 billion Sukuk (perpetual bond) on 27 February 2020 which will be utilized
for the future expansion plans. We opine that gearing up by issuing perpetual bond during the low interest rate environment is encouraging for the Group as it will strengthen its balance sheet with higher equity base to RM3981.2m (+55% YoY) from RM2536.9m. Likewise, the Group’s net gearing is reduced to 0.24 times.
Risks include: 1) Lower than expected demand for gloves, 2) Possible COVID-19 labour infection to disrupt production.
Earnings Outlook/Revision
We revise upward our FY20F earnings forecasts by +4.7% to RM487.6m from RM465.4m on the expectation of strong USD against MYR to be persisted in the next few months.
Valuation & Recommendation
Upgrade to BUY with a higher target price of RM6.50 (previous target price of RM4.73) after our earnings upgrade. Our revised target price is now pegged at 34x FY20F PER, which is at +1 standard deviation 5-year historical mean PE on the back of brighter outlook in respect of resilient glove demand.

Top Glove’s (TG) 2QFY19 PATMI increased to RM115.7m (+3.8% qoq, +9.3% yoy) mainly due to increase in overall glove sales volume (+2% qoq, +1% yoy). On qoq, TG sales volume of latex and surgical gloves improved by 11% and 18% qoq respectively. Aspion recorded a positive result, with their surgical glove sales increasing by 29% qoq. Together with overall lower operating expenses, TG’s PATMI margin improved slightly to 9.4% (+0.2 ppts).
Key highlights. Increasing orders were observed during the quarter with current plant utilization rate at c.90%. We estimate utilisation rate to be around 90% in FY20 due to higher demand driven by the Covid- 19 pandemic. Plants F2B and F5A have recently started operations and will add 3.2bn pcs of capacity. The group overall capacity is expected to increase to 81.6bn pcs p.a. (+16%) by end 2020 (refer table 2).
Against estimates: Inline. 1HFY20 PATMI of RM227.1m was in-line with our and consensus estimate at 49% and 48% respectively.
Outlook. Glove demand recently has seen strong orders not just from China but also from Europe, US and other infected countries following the recent rapid spread of the virus worldwide. In view of this, TG sales order book has since doubled with continued strong near to mid-term outlook. Long-term demand remains on uptrend as the virus outbreak is set to generate greater global healthcare awareness especially in countries that previously have lower glove usage per capita. We have raised our earnings forecast higher for FY20/FY21 by 5%/3% to factor in the surge in demand. (table 3)
Our call. Following earnings revision, we have derived a new TP of RM6.50 (from RM6.30) based on PER of 31x (1SD above 5-yrs historical forward mean) pegged on FY21 EPS. Maintain BUY.

QoQ. Revenue increased to RM1.23bn (+1.7%) on the back of steady growth in sales volume (+2%).

On the other hand, sales volume from nitrile gloves segment fell by 4% due to stronger demand previously from US market due to flu season. Overall ASP remained flattish.

Effective tax rate remained at 11%, subsequently, core PATMI improved to RM123.6m (+14.9%, from RM77.4m)
YoY. Revenue improved (+6%) due to the increase in sales volume (+2%). Particularly higher sales volume was achieved from nitrile glove segment (+14%), and surgical glove segment (+18%), whereas sales volume for natural rubber gloves were softer (-6%). ASP improved (+5%) due to higher selling prices from latex, vinyl and surgical gloves. EBITDA margin remain steady (+0.1 ppts) on the back of mixed raw materials prices; higher NR prices (+19% to RM4.37/kg) and lower NBR prices (-8.3% to USD1.00/kg). Lower tax expense of RM14.4m (-24%, from 2QFY19: RM18.8m) with lower effective tax rate of 11% (vs. 2QFY19: 15%) was due to tax incentives from its ongoing expansion and recognition of deferred tax assets. All in, core PATMI increased (+59.7%) to RM123.6m (from RM77.4m) due to EIs and tax.
YTD. Revenue increased to RM2.44bn (+0.7%) attributed to higher volumes (+0.6% YoY). EBITDA grew by 0.7%; with steady margin at 15.6% on the back of greater operational efficiencies. Core PATMI improved by 10.1% to RM231.3m, due to above mentioned factors (stronger sales volume and lower tax; 11% vs 1HFY19: 18%).
Capacity expansion. Top Glove currently operates at 90% capacity, with 711 lines producing 73.4bn pieces of gloves per year. In 2020 it will add c.8.2bn pieces in capacity bringing total installed capacity to c.81.6bn pieces (+16.4% YoY) with 781 lines. Bulk of the capacity is set to come in the second half of the year. Furthermore in 2021, Top Glove will be adding c.9.5bn pieces more in capacity (+11.6%).
Outlook. We expect stronger 2HFY20 in view of the ongoing outbreak of Covid-19. We understand Top Glove received strong orders from Asian countries in the beginning of the outbreak and now Western countries have too increased orders.
Forecast. Maintain our forecasts pending analyst conference call briefing next week.
Maintain BUY, TP RM6.76. We maintain BUY with unchanged TP of RM6.76. Our TP is based on FY20 earnings pegged to PE multiple of 35x. Top Glove is a good hedge against the broader market negatives from Covid-19 and weak ringgit.

topglove,"Fri, 20 Mar 2020, 9:44 AM",Top Glove Corporation Berhad - Panic Buying to Drive Future Earnings - PublicInvest Research | I3investor,https://klse.i3investor.com/blogs/PublicInvest/2020-03-20-story-h1484928387-Top_Glove_Corporation_Berhad_Panic_Buying_to_Drive_Future_Earnings.jsp,"Top Glove’s 1HFY20 net profit was flat, +0.7% YoY to RM227.1m. The Group’s results came in within both our and consensus projection at 48% and 47% respectively. The slight improvement was due to stronger contribution from the nitrile glove segment as well as lower tax expense. In view of the recent Covid-19 outbreak that is affecting 162 countries as at the time of writing, we expect the coming quarters for Top Glove to be exceptionally strong, given that gloves are essential medical items. We reiterate our Outperform call on Top Glove, with an unchanged TP of RM8.60.
Performance summary. Top Glove’s 2QFY20 revenue grew by 6% YoY to RM1.23bn, predominantly due to stronger growth in nitrile glove sales volume (+14% YoY). Latex glove sales volume, however, was down by 6% YoY, despite showing improvements QoQ, signifying that the Group is regaining its market share in the latex glove segment. Operating profit was only up by 2.8% YoY to RM149.4m, due to a sudden spike in latex concentrate prices that could not be fully passed on to clients in time, subsequently eroding EBIT margins from 12.5% in 2QFY19 to 12.1% in 2QFY20. Note that the latex concentrate’s price spiked by 19% YoY in 2QFY20. Net profit margin, however, has improved by 0.3ppts YoY to 9.4% in 2QFY20, mainly due to lower effective tax rate of 11% (2QFY19: 15%), as the Group benefitted from tax incentive from some of its subsidiaries.
Expansion outlook. Top Glove currently has 711 lines installed, with total installed capacity standing at 73.4bn pcs pa. The Group targets to commission its F40’s 1st Phase (+2.7bn pcs nitrile glove pa) in 2QCY20 and F8A 1st Phase (+3.5bn pcs nitrile glove pa) in 4QCY20. As for its new vinyl glove plant (+2.0bn pcs) in Vietnam, construction is underway and commissioning of lines is expected to begin in 3QCY20. By the end of CY20, the Group’s total installed capacity should effectively reach 81.6bn pcs pa.
Covid-19 impact. Following the Covid-19 outbreak that has swept across the globe, impacting supply chains and causing negative demand shocks, Top Glove was among the very few beneficiaries from this pandemic as gloves are essential medical supplies. Top Glove sales order book has doubled as a result of this outbreak and ASP has also been revised upwards by 3-5%, and we believe the ASP revision will result in margin expansion in the coming quarters. In the early stage of this outbreak, the extra demand was mainly coming from Asian countries like China, Hong Kong and China. But as the virus spread across different continents, demand is now largely coming from US and EU. The Group has also secured large orders for delivery in the coming months, with some clients already placing orders 6 months ahead of time, as opposed to the usual 3 months.

The FBM KLCI (-1.6%) continue its’ free fall for the sixth straight session, taking cue from the continuous selling activities on Wall Street overnight, coupled with the rising risk of recession. The lower liners - the FBM Small Cap (- 6.9%), FBM Fledgling (-5.2%) and FBM ACE (-6.7%), all remain down beat, while the broader market were painted in red with the energy sector (-9.3%) being the worst performer after crude oil prices sank to the lowest level since 2002.
Expectedly, market breadth remained negative as losers trounced gainers on a ratio of 849-to-170 stocks. Traded volumes, however, rose 19.4% to 4.17 bln shares as selling activities remain unabated.
Nestle (-RM1.20) topped the local bourse’ decliners list, followed by Hong Leong Financial Group (-82.0 sen), Malaysia Airport Holdings (-55.0 sen), Hong Leong Bank (-44.0 sen) and Public Bank (-36.0 sen). Notable decliners on the broader market were Panasonic (- RM2.50), Carlsberg (-RM1.60), Heineken (-RM1.60), Batu Kawan (-RM1.42), and Aeon Credit (-RM1.13).
On other side of the trade, significant advancers on the broader market include MPI (+28.0 sen), Country Height Holdings (+15.0 sen), Eurospan Holdings (+14.0 sen), Sand Nisko Capital (+12.0 sen) and Kluang Rubber (+9.0 sen). Outperformers on the FBM KLCI were IHH (+35.0 sen), PBB Group (+30.0 sen), Hartalega (+18.0 sen), Sime Darby Plantations (+18.0 sen) and Top Glove (+10.0 sen).
Asia benchmark indices continued their downtrend on concern over the economic impact from Covid-19 pandemic continue to pile pressure on sentiment as the Nikkei contracted 1.0%. The Shanghai Composite fell 1.0%, while the Hang Seng Index dipped 2.6%. Asia stockmarkets, meanwhile, finished mostly lower yesterday.
U.S. stockmarkets managed to recover from their intraday losses as the Dow gained 1.0% on mild bargain hunting activities, particularly in energy and technology shares as investors continue to monitor on developments in regards to Covid-19. On the broader market, the S&P 500 added 0.5%, while the Nasdaq jumped 2.3%.
Earlier, European stockmarkets - the FTSE (+1.4%), CAC (+2.7%) and DAX (+2.0%), all rebounded as the former was boosted by the Bank of England’s surprise interest rate cut to 0.1% increased the bond-buying program to by additional £200.0 bln to £645.0 bln. At the same time, the European Central Bank has outlined a “Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme” that will use €750.0 bln to purchase securities to help support the European economy.
The Day Ahead
There is no change to our near term view as we continue to think that the market is still dour with measures undertaken by financial institutions failed to provide a lift. After shedding close to 250 points in recent weeks, we reckon a rebound is due on the FBM KLCI on the back of stimulus measures announced by central banks across the globe, including Bank Negara’s move to cut the statutory reserve requirement ratio by 100 basis points.
Although we think that a rebound is already due after the FBM KLCI’s incessant falls, any rebound is likely to be weak. Therefore, the 1,250 level will serve as the immediate hurdle for now. In the meantime, the continuing weakness is likely to see the FBM KLCI attempting to find support at the 1,200 level, but if it gives way, the 1,150 level could serve as the next major support.
Elsewhere, we re-iterate our stance on the weak sentiments dominating the lower liners and broader market shares, in tandem with the insipid conditions among the index heavyweights. Although valuations have turned appealing, a firm recovery is still off the table for the time being.

2Q20 vs 2Q19:
Top Glove在2020财年第2季度实现了12.3亿令吉的销售收入，比2019财年第2季度增长了6％。税前利润和税后利润分别为1.304亿令吉和1.16亿令吉，分别比去年同期增长3.9％和8.7％。这归因于稳定的销售量（售出数量）增长，其中丁腈手套部门的增长特别强劲，与2019财年第二季度相比，其销量增长了14％。天然橡胶手套的销量较2019财年第二季度下降6％，而利润率受到天然橡胶胶乳浓缩物价格上涨19％的影响，而平均售价（ASP）的相应增长不足以抵消。同时，由于顶级手套通过积极的营销策略恢复了市场份额，并且生产利用率也有所提高，天然橡胶手套的季度销量quarter-on-quarter增长了11％。税后盈利为1.16亿令吉，year-on-year同期增长8.7％，这是由于集团继续享受其持续扩张的税收优惠以及部分子公司的未动用免税额。
在1HFY2020，Top Glove的销售收入为24.4亿令吉，比1HFY19的销售收入和销量均有所提高。税前利润为2亿5580万令吉，减少4.3％，而税后利润为2亿2780万令吉，较1HFY2019增加4.4％。
由于过去两年来实施的改进措施，Aspion的业绩也取得了显着进步，Aspion手术手套的销量year-on-year大幅增长了29％。从生产到营销，Aspion的整个运营活动将继续加大改进力度，以确保集团充分发挥Aspion的潜力，并在外科手术手套领域建立更大的影响力。天然橡胶乳胶平均价格为4.37令吉/千克，较2019财年第二季度上涨19％，而丁腈乳胶平均价格为1美元/千克，同比下降8.3％。
2Q20 vs 1Q20:
集团在2020财年第2季度的销售收入为12.3亿令吉，增长1.7％，销量（售出数量）比2020财年第1季度增长2％。尤其是，天然橡胶手套的销售额quarter-on-quarter增长了11％，带来了更高的利润率，因为顶级手套从竞争对手那里夺回了市场份额。同时，税前利润和税后利润分别增长3.9％至1亿3040万令吉和3.8％至1亿1600万令吉。在本季度的回顾中，Aspion的业绩也有所改善，外科手套的销售额比2020财年第一季度增长了29％。天然橡胶胶乳浓缩物平均价格为每公斤4.37令吉，较2020年第一季度上涨5.8％，丁腈乳胶的平均价格为1美元/千克，quarter on quarter下降5.3％。
前景：
鉴于全球手套需求的增长，Top Glove将继续扩大其业务，以确保其能帮助保护和挽救生命，特别是考虑到持续爆发的COVID-19。在爆发初期，销售订单主要来自中国，香港，新加坡和韩国。但是，随着COVID-19迅速扩展到全球其他大洲，该集团最近几周也收到了来自欧洲，美国和其他国家的强劲销售订单，这使该集团的销售订单翻了一番。顶级手套还预计，世界卫生组织（WHO）于2020年3月12日宣布COVID-19爆发为大流行，最终将导致医疗保健和其他部门需要更多的医疗用品，例如手套和其他必需品。
当前的机器利用率水平超过90％，Top Glove能够进一步将机器利用率提高到接近100％，以满足需求的激增。此外，随着F2B和F5A的开始运营，它将有新的产能投产，到全面运营时，这将增加总共24条生产线和每年32亿只手套的产能。
未来的扩长将使集团的生产线总数增加150条，每年的生产能力将增加177亿只手套。到2021年12月，顶级手套预计将拥有861条生产线，每年的手套生产能力为911亿只。
2020年1月23日，Top Glove被马来西亚Rating Corporation Berhad（MARC）授予AA的公司信用评级，这是马来西亚制造公司获得的最高评级。这表明Top Glove在全球范围内强劲且可持续的手套需求的支持下，显示出强劲的收入增长和净利润，正现金流量产生，稳定的营运资金管理。
在另一项发展中，Top Glove于2020年3月2日与Adventa Capital Pte Ltd达成了一项有关子公司Top Care购买Aspion Sdn. Bhd.的所有纠纷的和解协议。作为协议的一部分，Top Care总共获得了2.45亿令吉，作为争端的全部和最终解决，所有当事方将撤回其各自的法律主张，而无权提起新诉讼。和解协议不会对Top Glove的已发行和缴足股本产生任何影响，并有望改善现金流。结算产生的现金收入将与投资成本抵销，相关商誉将相应减少。 Top Glove认为，友好解决争端符合他们和利益相关者的最大利益，使他们能够专注于发展各自的业务。
展望未来，集团预见了非常稳固的季度，在COVID-19疫情爆发后，已经获得了未来几个月的超大销售订单，COVID-19疫情见证了手套销售订单的激增，这是医疗领域的重要项目。此外，其他几个因素的相互作用，包括最近的油价暴跌，也预示着Top Glove的2HFY2020表现良好。随着认识和使用的增加，对手套的需求预计每年还将继续以至少10％的速度增长，尤其是在COVID-19大流行的情况下。在此期间开始使用手套的新用户，即使在疫情消退之后也有望继续使用，并且已经意识到他们在保护生命方面的重要性，就像过去的H1N1疫情一样。

[TOP GLOVE CORP BHD: Top Glove is able to further ramp up production close to 100%, to meet the surge in demand; moreover, it has new capacity coming onstream with F2B and F5A having commenced operations, which will add a total of 24 lines and a capacity 3.2 billion pieces of gloves per annum, when fully operational]
2Q20 vs 2Q19:
Top Glove achieved Sales Revenue of RM1.23 billion in 2QFY2020, an increase of 6% compared with 2QFY2019. Profit Before Tax and Profit After Tax came in at RM130.4 million and RM116 million, up 3.9% and 8.7% respectively against the corresponding period last year. This was attributed to steady Sales Volume (Quantity Sold) growth, with particularly strong growth in the nitrile glove segment, where there was a 14% increase in Sales Volume versus 2QFY2019. Sales Volume for natural rubber gloves was softer by 6% against 2QFY2019, while margins were impacted by a 19% surge in natural rubber latex concentrate prices which the corresponding increase in average selling prices (ASP) was not sufficient to offset. Meanwhile, quarter-on-quarter Sales Volume for natural rubber gloves improved by 11% as Top Glove recovered market share through aggressive marketing strategies and production utilisation also increased. Profit After Tax was RM116 million, increasing by 8.7% year-on-year, as the Group continued to enjoy tax incentives from its ongoing expansion, as well as unutilised tax allowances from some of its subsidiaries.
For 1HFY2020, Top Glove delivered Sales Revenue of RM2.44 billion, an improvement from 1HFY19 in terms of both Sales Revenue and Sales Volume. Profit Before Tax was RM255.8 million, easing 4.3% while Profit After Tax was RM227.8 million, an increase of 4.4% versus 1HFY2019.
The Group also recorded significant progress in Aspion’s performance arising from enhancement initiatives implemented over the past 2 years, as Sales Volume for Aspion’s surgical gloves grew substantially by 29% year-on-year. Improvement efforts will continue to be intensified across Aspion’s operations from Production to Marketing, to ensure the Group realises Aspion’s full potential and establishes a bigger presence in the surgical glove segment. Average natural rubber latex concentrate prices at RM4.37/kg, up 19% against 2QFY2019, while the average nitrile latex price was USD1/kg, down 8.3% year on year.
2Q20 vs 1Q20:
The Group’s Sales Revenue for 2QFY2020 was RM1.23 billion, up 1.7%, with growth in Sales Volume (Quantity Sold) of 2% versus 1QFY2020. In particular, quarter-on-quarter Sales Volume for natural rubber gloves improved by 11%, delivering a higher profit margin as well, as Top Glove recovered market share from its competitors. Meanwhile, Profit Before Tax and Profit After Tax trended upward by 3.9% to RM130.4 million and 3.8% to RM116 million respectively. Aspion’s performance also improved during the quarter in review, with surgical glove sales increasing by 29% from 1QFY2020. Average natural rubber latex concentrate prices at RM4.37/kg, up 5.8% against 1QFY2020, while the average nitrile latex price was USD1/kg, down 5.3% quarter on quarter.
Prospects:
Top Glove will continue to expand its operations in line with the growing glove demand globally to ensure it is well positioned to help protect and save lives, particularly in view of the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19. At the initial stage of the outbreak, sales orders came mainly from China, Hong Kong, Singapore and South Korea. However, the Group has in recent weeks also received strong sales orders from Europe, US and other countries as well, following its rapid spread to other continents across the globe, which has seen the Group’s sales order book double. The Group also anticipates that the declaration of the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic by the World Health Organisation (WHO) on 12 March 2020, will eventually result in the healthcare and other sectors requiring more medical supplies such as gloves and other essential items.
With current utilisation levels above 90%, Top Glove is able to further ramp up production close to 100%, to meet the surge in demand. Moreover, it has new capacity coming onstream with F2B and F5A having commenced operations, which will add a total of 24 lines and a capacity 3.2 billion pieces of gloves per annum, when fully operational.
Future expansion will boost the Group’s total number of production lines by an additional 150 lines and production capacity by 17.7 billion gloves per annum. By December 2021, Top Glove is projected to have a total of 861 production lines and a production capacity of 91.1 billion gloves per annum.
On 23 January 2020, Top Glove was assigned a corporate credit rating of AA by the Malaysia Rating Corporation Berhad (MARC), the highest rating to be accorded to a Malaysian manufacturing company. This indicates Top Glove’s demonstrated strong revenue growth and net profit, positive cash flow generation, with stable working capital management, backed by strong and sustainable glove demand globally.
In another development, Top Glove on 2 March 2020 entered into a settlement agreement with Adventa Capital Pte Ltd in relation to all disputes concerning the purchase of Aspion Sdn. Bhd. by its subsidiary Top Care. As part of the agreement, Top Care received a total of RM245 million as full and final settlement of the disputes and all parties are to withdraw their respective legal claims, with no liberty to file fresh proceedings. The settlement will not have any effect on the issued and paid-up share capital of Top Glove and is expected to improve cashflow. Cash proceeds from the settlement will be netted off against the cost of investment and the related goodwill will be reduced accordingly. Top Glove believes that settling their dispute amicably is in their best interests as well as that of their stakeholders, enabling them to focus exclusively on growing their respective businesses.
Going forward, the Group envisions very solid quarters ahead, having already secured exceptionally large sales orders for the next few months on the back of the COVID-19 outbreak, which saw a surge in sales orders for gloves, an essential item in the medical sector. Moreover, the interplay of several other factors, which include the recent plunge in oil prices, augur well for Top Glove’s performance for 2HFY2020. Demand for gloves is also expected to continue to grow by at least 10% every year, as awareness and usage increases, all the more so with the COVID-19 pandemic. New users who have started using gloves during this period are expected to continue usage even after the outbreak recedes, having gained an appreciation of their importance in protecting lives, as was the case with past outbreaks such as H1N1.

The share price could however, be capped by the conversion of exchangeable bonds. Recall, back in 2019, Top Glove issued USD200m in convertible bonds as part of their debt restructuring. The bonds can be converted into new shares at RM6.10 per share. TP is RM5.95 based on 32x CY20E EPS. Reiterate MP.
Key results’ highlights. QoQ, 2QFY20 revenue rose 2% due to higher sales volume (+2%) led by latex (+11%) but more than offset lower nitrile (-4%). PBT margin improved marginally by 0.2ppt from 10.4% in 1QFY20 to 10.6% in 2QFY20 due to better efficiency from economies of scale. This brings 2QFY20 PATAMI to RM116m (+4%). No dividend was declared as expected.
YoY, 1HFY20 revenue came in flat (+0.7%) due to lower ASP (-0.1%) but mitigated by higher sales volume (+0.6%). Interestingly, ASPION showed marked improvement from low base recording a net profit of RM13m (+30%). 1HFY20 PATAMI was higher by 5% to RM227m boosted by a lower effective tax rate of 11% compared to 18% in 1HFY19.
Subsequent quarters’ earnings to be driven by new capacity expansion, potentially higher ASPs and weakening USD/MYR. Initially in the early stage of the virus outbreak, sales orders came mainly from China, Hong Kong, Singapore and South Korea. TOPGLOV has in recent weeks also received strong sales orders from Europe, US and other countries. With current utilisation levels > 90%, the group is able to further ramp up production close to 100%, to meet the surge in demand. It has new capacity coming on-stream with F2B and F5A having commenced operations, which will add 3.2bn pieces of gloves per annum, when fully operational. Ceteris paribus, each 1% increase in volume sales and ASP will raise our FY20E net profit by 1% and 1.2%, respectively.
Weakening of Ringgit (MYR) vs. US dollar (USD) is positive to rubber glove players. YTD, the USD had risen by 8% against the RM (USD1 = RM4.40). Since sales are USD-denominated, theoretically, a depreciating ringgit against the dollar will lead to higher revenue receipts for glove makers. Ceteris paribus, a 1% weakening of RM against USD will lead to an average 1%-2% increase in the net profit of rubber glove players.
Expansion plans. Top Glove’s capacity expansion include:- Factory 7A (operational by end-1Q 2020; 0.4bn pieces latex gloves), Factory 2B (operational by 1Q 2020; 0.7b pieces nitrile gloves), Factory 5A (operational by 1Q 2020; 2.5b pieces nitrile gloves), Factory 40 (Phase 1 operational by 2Q 2020 and Phase 2 operational by 3Q 2020; 2.7b and 2.0b pieces, nitrile gloves, respectively), Factory F41 (operational 2Q 2020; 4b pieces PVC gloves) and Factory 8A (operational by 4Q 2020; 3.5b pieces nitrile gloves) which will boost the group’s total production capacity in 2020 by 11.8b gloves per annum to 81.9b (+17%).
Reiterate MP. TP is RM5.95 based on unchanged 32x CY20E EPS (at +1.5SD above 5-year historical forward mean). The share price could be capped by the conversion of exchangeable bonds. Recall, back in 2019, Top Glove issued USD200m in convertible bonds as part of their debt restructuring. The bonds can be converted into new shares at RM6.10 per share.
A key upside risk to our call is the higher-than-expected volume sales.

Management plans to increase its current utilisation to 100%, due to the recent surge in demand for rubber gloves. The delivery lead time has now lengthened to 4 months, which is significantly longer than the 15-30 days in early January. Reiterate BUY with a higher TP of RM7.50.
New Capacity to Meet Stronger Demand
Although overall sales volume for 1HFY20 only grew by a marginal 0.6% yoy, we are expecting a significantly stronger performance in 2HFY20, supported by stronger demand due to Covid-19. We believe that Top Glove is a likely beneficiary as the recently completed plant F2B and F5A would add an additional 5% to its current capacity. TOPG will also be ramping up its current utilisation rate from 90% to 100%, as the current delivery lead time has increased from 15-30 days in early January to 4 months. We are now forecasting sales volume to grow by 13% (from 8%) for FY20E.
Limited Impact From the Restrictive Movement Order for Now
As the glove manufacturers are being labelled as essential industries, there are no restrictions on their production activities. However, there is risk that its new plant F40 might not be able to commence on time (by 2Q20), if the government decides not to include the expansion work in the exemption list. Plant F40 will add an additional 4% to its current capacity. Although TOPG has sufficient workers for its existing plants, if the current restriction is expanded beyond March, TOPG might be faced with labour shortages, as foreigners are not allowed to enter Malaysia at the moment.
Reiterate BUY With a Higher TP of RM7.50
To factor in the stronger demand outlook, we are raising our EPS forecast for FY20E by 8.9% and raise our 12-month TP to RM7.50 based on an unchanged 40x PER on our CY20 estimate. Top Glove remains one of our Top BUY picks for the country and sector.
Key risks to our call include: 1) intensifying competition from other countries; 2) higher volatility in raw-material prices; and 3) worsening labor issues.

We maintain HOLD on Top Glove with a higher fair value of RM6.28/share (RM6.21/share previously). We have raised Top Glove’s earnings forecasts by 10% and 1% for FY20F and FY21F respectively to account for higher sales volume, a recovery of the latex gloves’ market share and lower raw material costs. Our valuation is based on a PE of 33x on FY21F EPS.
The addition of the F2B (refurbishment) and F5A (new) plant would bring its total capacity to 73.4bil pieces by 3QFY20 (+4% QoQ). In total, Top Glove’s expansion plan includes an additional 8.2bil pieces (+16% YoY) by Dec 2020 and 9.5bil pieces (+12% YoY) by Dec 2021.
Top Glove’s 1HFY20 net profit of RM227.1mil (+5% YoY) was in line with both our and street’s expectations, making up around 47–48% of earnings forecasts.
Top Glove’s 2QFY20’s QoQ revenue grew 2% to RM2,439mil. The 11% QoQ increase in the volume of latex gloves can be attributed to a recovery in market share resulting from aggressive marketing. EBIT margin also improved to 12.1% in 2QFY20 from 11.7% in 1QFY20 due to higher ASP of latex gloves (+3%).
2QFY20 YoY revenue grew 6%. Higher sales volume of nitrile gloves (+14%) more than compensated for a 6% drop in the sales of latex gloves resulting from increased competition.
EBIT grew at a slower 3% in 2QFY20 compared with the revenue growth of 6% as the group suffered higher latex price. The 19% increase in latex price could not be fully passed on as the increase in selling price was only 9%. ASP of nitrile gloves declined by 3% in tandem with 7% cheaper nitrile prices.
Top Glove’s net margin improved slightly (+0.3ppt) in 2QFY20 due to a lower effective tax rate (11% from 15% previously) as the group utilised tax incentives from its ongoing expansions.
Top Glove’s 1HFY20 revenue rose 1% with 0.6% higher sales volume and flattish ASPs. Aspion’s surgical gloves sales volume shot up 29% with the group’s enhancement initiatives. Aspion contributed circa RM11mil to the group’s PBT.
Latex product mix is now higher at 43% in 2QFY20 (39% in 1QFY20) as Top Glove regained some latex gloves’ market share. We believe this led to an EBIT margin contraction of 0.7ppt in 1HFY20 as latex gloves command lower margins compared with nitrile gloves.
Top Glove said that during the initial stage of Covid-19, sales orders came mainly from China, Hong Kong, Singapore and South Korea. Recently, the group has received orders from Europe, the US and other countries. The group’s sales order book doubled following the rapid spread of Covid-19.
We expect sequential improvement in Top Glove’s profitability as sales orders soar. The group will also benefit from increased capacity as its expansion plan progresses. We forecast Top Glove’s net earnings to grow by 44% in FY20F and net margin to improve to 9.8% from 7.6% on the back of stronger demand, weaker MYR against USD and lower commodity prices.
However, assuming Covid-19 is contained within FY20F, we anticipate a slower sales growth in FY21F due to an excess supply of inventory. We forecast Top Glove’s net profit to contract by 8% in FY21F.

该公司首6个月净利为2亿2710万9000令吉，比前期2亿1584万7000令吉净利增加5.21%。
该公司第二季营业额为12亿2977万7000令吉，比前期的11亿5996万5000令吉增加6.01%；首6个月的营业额为24亿3887万7000令吉，比前期的24亿2193万令吉微增0.69%。
丁腈手套销售增14%
橡胶手套跌6%
该公司第二季营收增加，主要是获得稳定销售量成长支持，特别是丁腈手套领域取得强劲的14%销售成长挹注。相较之下，橡胶手套的销售量则按年下跌6%，特别是浓缩天然乳胶价格攀升19%而冲击其赚幅，以致平均销售价走高却不足以全面抵消劣势。
顶级手套执行主席丹斯里林伟才在文告中指出，冠病疫情扩散的初步阶段，该公司的销售订单主要来自中国、香港、新加坡及韩国。
“最近公司开始接到来自全球的强劲订单，包括欧洲、美国等其他国家，使公司订单总额倍增。”
他指出，目前该公司工厂使用率超过90%，未来可提高至近100%，以应付剧增的市场需求。
“同时公司即将有新的产能，包括F2B及F5A工厂已开始投产，当全面投产后，预料增加的24条生产线的年产量将额外增加32亿只手套，该公司也将推行更多的产能扩张计划。”
截至2021年12月为止，该公司预料将拥有39间手套工厂及861条生产线，产品年产能达到911亿只手套。
销售订单倍增
展望未来，该公司预计将创下更佳的业绩，接下来的月份因新型冠状病毒的爆发而接获了庞大的销售订单；销售订单的提升主要因手套乃医疗行业中无可或缺的物品。
该公司补充，其他因素的相互作用，包括近期油价暴跌，亦预示着顶级手套于2020财务年下半年的表现。
“随着意识和使用率的提升，手套需求量预计每年将持续增长至少10%，尤其于新型冠状病毒大肆蔓延之下。”
林伟才表示：“顶级手套很幸运的处于对经济和政治动荡相对不明确的医疗行业里。尽管集团的销售量于此次疫情中猛力上涨，然而我们并不愿看到如此多的疾病及苦难。该公司将持续以健康的状态工作，及尽我们的能力确保集团生产优质的手套以控制疫情，同时保护和挽救生命。”

On Friday alone, the index fell 5.3% on the back of escalating fears over the Covid-19 pandemic and weaker oil prices. Macquarie Equities Research (MQ Research) wrote a report this morning (16 Mar), naming stocks that stand out to them that investors may consider accumulating, including glovemakers Top Glove and Hartalega, as well as defensive names such as Public Bank…
Event
The KLCI dropped the most since 2008 on 13 March 2020 (-5.3%), on the back of escalating global fears of the Covid-19 pandemic and weaker oil prices, which have raised the risk of a global recession. Exchange traded funds (ETF) related selling has potentially also exacerbated the selloff.
MQ Research screened the 50 stocks under its coverage and found that while valuations across the sectors are above Asian Financial Crisis (AFC) levels, banks, gaming (Genting Malaysia), construction and oil & gas are nearing Global Financial Crisis (GFC) levels, while property is below GFC levels. Stocks that standout as nearing GFC levels are Public Bank, HL Bank, CIMB, AMBank, MISC, IJM and Gamuda. Meanwhile Petronas Chemical is trading at its lowest price-to-book ratio (PB) levels since its IPO in 2010.  
Impact
Global lockdown likely to weigh on gross domestic product (GDP). As countries around the world begin to impose restrictions on the movement of people and supply chains are impacted, MQ Research expects Malaysia’s GDP growth to be further impacted. The sharp pull back in oil prices is also set to weigh. For now MQ Research assumes a bear case GDP growth of 2.7% with the budget deficit expanding to 4.3% and debt to GDP at 54% as a result. While MQ Research doesn’t expect unemployment rates to jump significantly it does expect that wages will come under pressure in the service sector (tourism, hotels, F&B etc).
Risks contained – oil & gas, property, airlines with greatest stress. Based on MQ Research’s screen of projected cashflows and debt positions as at end 2020, MQ Research finds that a significant portion of its coverage are unlikely to face financial stress from a slowdown in GDP. Where risks are elevated are in the property, oil & gas and airline sectors where geared balance sheets face elevated risks from a slowdown in the economy and cashflows.
Outlook
Bombed out names worth accumulating to ride out the storm. While it is unclear if markets have already bottomed or more downside lies ahead, MQ Research believes investors should look to accumulate quality names which have been battered in the recent selldown. Public Bank, Tenaga and MISC are defensive names which MQ Research believes have been hit due to fundflows and offer good value.
Rebound plays. Petronas Chemical, Genting Malaysia and Malaysia Airports standout as plays for when newsflow around covid-19 improve.
Domestic reflation. Construction and infra names, Econpile, Ranhill and Gamuda, are beneficiaries of the new government accelerating infrastructure projects to stimulate the economy. Banks should benefit too, although MQ Research is mindful of credit risks and falling rates in the near term.
Global thematics still attractive. MQ Research maintains its positive view on glove producers (Top Glove, Hartalega), crude palm oil (Sime Plant) and healthcare (IHH).

We maintain our HOLD call on Top Glove Corporation (Top Glove) with a higher fair value of RM6.21. We have raised our P/E multiple further to 33x (+3 SDs). Our valuation is now based on a P/E of 33x FY21F EPS. We have raised Top Glove’s FY20F net profit by 13.6%. However, we have lowered our FY21F and FY22F earnings forecasts for Top Glove by 3.0% and 2.4% respectively.
We like Top Glove for its expansionary plans and position as the world’s largest glove manufacturer. However, it faces stiffer competition (compared with Kossan and Hartalega) as Thailand-based Sri Trang aggressively expands its latex capacity. We believe Top Glove’s PE is fully valued at 34.8x FY20 EPS compared to Kossan’s PE of 22.5x.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the coronavirus, Covid-19, a pandemic, urging governments to step up containment efforts as the number of worldwide cases topped 120K and deaths exceeded 4.3K.
Recall that during the previous major pandemic outbreak, Top Glove’s earnings and share price increased. At the start of the 2009–2010 H1N1 pandemic, Top Glove’s share price was RM0.73 and it rose to RM1.80 in about 15 months, by the end of the pandemic as shown in Exhibit 1.
Previously during the H1N1 pandemic, Top Glove’s revenue and net profit rose 36.0% and 38.6% respectively in FY10 as demand soared. This resulted in a 0.3ppt improvement in net margins (11.8% in FY10).
We believe that orders for gloves during the outbreak were high as customers stock up more than usual as a pre-emptive measure. However, post-outbreak, there was an excess supply in the customers’ inventory which lowered sales growth. Top Glove’s revenue dropped 1.2% and net profit plunged 54.4% in FY11.
Top Glove was hit by the shift in demand from latex gloves to nitrile gloves. Latex raw material price was also at an all-time high in FY11, reaching RM10.83/kg as shown in Exhibit 3.
Top Glove’s 1-year average trading P/E was 11.2x before the WHO declared H1N1 as a pandemic. Its P/E peaked at 20.2x (+7.2 SDs) in April 2010.
We believe that Top Glove will benefit from an expected increase in demand for gloves arising from the Covid-19 pandemic. We expect Top Glove to record higher sales volume in FY20F. Its performance will also be boosted by the contribution from its planned capacity expansion +16.8% in CY20F.
We forecast Top Glove’s FY20F net earnings to grow by 31.4% YoY and net margin to improve to 8.7% from 7.6%.
However, as the Covid-19 pandemic is expected to be contained in 2020F, we anticipate a slower sales growth in FY21F due to an excess supply of inventory. We forecast Top Glove’s net profit to grow by only 0.5% as net margin contracts by 0.4% in FY21F.

联昌研究指出，该行所追踪的手套制造商均出现强劲的需求及超过3个月的积压订单。
除此之外，世界卫生组织还敦促各国准备好应急系统来应对冠病，包括提高发现冠病和照顾病人能力、提倡各国储备好医疗设施所需用品。
大马橡胶手套厂商协会（MARGMA）也在近期透露，为免全球出现手套短缺情况，世界卫生组织已向他们联系。
因此该行预计，手套制造商将在今年尤其是次季取得强稳的盈利表现，主要原因是手套的需求增高带来了更大的经济规模和更好的定价权，再加上美元走高这有力的营运环境和原材料价格下降。
手套产能扩大14.1%
此外，今年各公司逐步实施的产能扩张计划，使产能按年扩大了14.1%，也有助提高公司盈利。
联昌以全球手套需求增长8至9%为基准，预测所追踪的手套股今年营业额将上涨14%。
“但鉴于大马橡胶手套厂商协会最近显示，全球手套需求强劲增长迹象来看，该增长率很可能会被超过。”
该行预测，以目前预计的82至85%厂房利用率而言，每个手套制造商利用率若增长5%，将提高2020至2022财政年财测上扬6.8至10.1%。
综合上述，该行维持对该领域的“增持”评级，并给予4大手套股“加码”评级，其中顶级手套和高产柅品则被选为首选股。

 回顾2010年的H1N1流感大流行 (Pandemic) ，当时的厂房使用率达95%。作为参考，其营业额按季增长29%。由于已升级为“大流行”，美国医疗行业规定要增加手套存货，导致订单激增。
 自从肺炎爆发后，旗下生产线使用率从85%提升至88-89%，至今仍有进一步提高的空间。必须强调，疫情至今仍未被世卫组织升级为“大流行”。
 与平常时期比较，今年2月期间的手套订单按周激增高达100%。来自中国和香港的订单增加5倍、新加坡3倍。
 以中国为例，目前每年人均手套使用量仅为6只，印尼2只以及印度3只，对比美国的150只。这足以说明全球手套增长仍有不小的空间。
 经过疫情之后，相信很多新兴国家的卫生意识已有所提高，往后将继续使用手套。尽管如此，参考以往的H1N1流感。在疫情消散后，手套订单恢复正常水平，因为很多企业不需要再堆积很多库存。
 目前每年可生产705亿只手套，计划在2021年底提升至914亿只。2020年和2021年预计新增114亿 (+16%) 和95亿 (+12%) 只手套。
 以往，每生产一百万只手套需要8.4个劳工，如今随着加入不少自动化机器，仅需要2.5个劳工。这也意味着生产效率逐渐获得改善。
 赚幅取决于原料成本、美金走势以及售价走势。以H1N1流感为例，除了营业额增加，其营运利润率也异常之高17.5%，对比之前平时的12-13%左右，主要归因于售价走高。即便是2015-2016年的强势美金时期，也仅是17-18%。如今为16%左右。

Glovemakers should benefit from the higher demand for gloves as Covid-19 spreads to more countries and the operating environment stays favourable.
Maintain Overweight, with Top Glove and Kossan as our top picks.
Covid-19 Spreads to More Than 102 Countries
The World Health Organisation (WHO) said that as of 9 Mar 2020 there were 105,586 confirmed cases (laboratory confirmed) of the Covid-19 globally, resulting in 3,584 deaths. While China continued to account for the bulk of the cases and death toll (76.6% of global cases; 86.5% of global deaths), the number of countries affected has continued to grow to more than 102, including most of the industrialised world.
WHO Has Signaled MARGMA Members to Ramp Up Glove Production
Our channel checks reveal that glovemakers under our coverage are seeing strong demand, with a robust order backlog of more than three months. Furthermore, WHO
has been
urging countries to plan for Covid-19 by preparing emergency response systems, including increasing capacity to detect and care for patients, and
advocating that countries stock up on required supplies for their healthcare facilities. (see statement)
The Malaysian Rubber Glove Manufacturer Association (MARGMA) also recently said WHO has contacted them to ensure there would be no worldwide shortage of gloves.
Expecting Glovemakers to Record Sequentially-stronger Earnings
In our view, glovemakers are likely to record stronger earnings, especially from 2QCY20 onwards. This will mainly be driven by:
higher demand for gloves leading to greater economies of scale and better pricing power,
a more conducive operating environment (weaker RM/US$ [YTD:-3.7%] and lower raw material prices, and
capacity expansion plans gradually coming on-stream throughout the year (FY20F: +14.1% y-o-y).
Potential Upside to Our EPS Forecasts
Based on our current forecasts, glove stocks under our coverage will record a 14% rise in CY20F revenue (still based on 8-9% global glove demand growth). In our view, this could be surpassed given recent indications by MARGMA of a strong surge in global glove demand.
Based on our estimates, every 5% pt rise in the utilisation rate of each glovemaker (current assumption: 82-85%) could lead to 6.8-10.1% upsides to our FY20- 22F EPS forecasts. Note that we have yet to factor in any upside to our EPS estimates from the likely higher demand for gloves arising from the Covid-19 outbreak.
Maintain Overweight; Glove Makers Should Continue to Trade Higher
Overall, we advise investors to stay overweight on the glove sector despite its premium valuation (near +2 s.d. from its 5-year mean), which is premised on strong global glove demand and a favourable operating environment, allowing glovemakers to outshine in terms of positive earnings growth in a volatile KLCI market.
Currently, we have ADD recommendations for all four glove stocks, with Top Glove and Kossan as our top picks.
Downside risks: sharp easing of coronavirus concerns and/or stronger ringgit vs. US$.

最新进展
顶级手套（TOPGLOV，7113，主板工业产品股）该公司将在本月底公布2020财年次季业绩报告。
目前的产能拓展计划包括工厂7A、2B、5A、40、41和8A，可在今年将总产能从每年118亿只手套，提高17%至819亿只。
行家建议
2019年冠状病毒疫情刺激丁腈手套的需求，我们预计2020财年次季按年和按季表现都会更好。
因此将今明两财年的净利预估分别上调12%，预计现财年的销量将会增长12%，优于先前预估的5%；2021财年的销量增长预估也从8%调高至14%。
目标价从5.30令吉上调至5.95令吉，较5年每股净利历史先行中值高1.5个标准差。该公司去年曾发行2亿美元（8.4亿令吉）的可转换债券，能以每股6.20令吉的价格转换成新股，所以限制了股价的涨势。
我们认为，丁腈手套将会持续增长并争夺乳胶手套的市占率。
假设今年的全球需求为3240亿只，比去年多8%，再估计丁腈和乳胶手套的市场比例分别为80和20%，意味着丁腈手套能取得30%的增长率，或额外510亿只来自顶级手套。目前，这两个产品的市场比例为67:33。
在其他条件不变的情况，销售量每增长1%，我们2020财年的净利预估将上调1%。

  Top Glove Corporation Berhad is the world’s largest manufacturer of gloves. It exports gloves to 195 countries and takes up 26% of the global glove market share. Its product portfolio consists of nitrile, natural rubber, and vinyl gloves. The rubber glove industry has experienced tremendous growth throughout the years. If one had invested in Top Glove since they were first listed in 2001 till the 2020 AGM, their total returns including dividends would have been 7,823%!
However, the past two years have been a bit bumpy for the entire rubber glove industry and Top Glove has not been spared from the oversupply issues in the industry which have reduced the average selling price of rubber gloves.
This industry-wide trouble was apparent in the kind of breakfast provided to shareholders before the AGM. In the previous year, Starbucks coffee was served; but this year, coffee from their canteen was served.
Here are 11 things I learned from the 2020 Top Glove AGM:
1. Revenue grew 13.8% year-on-year to RM4.8 billion in 2019 because of strong sales volume growth, particularly in the nitrile glove segment. The management has also targeted to earn at least RM5.0 billion in revenue in 2020. Top Glove also recently launched its BiogreenTM Biodegradable Nitrile Gloves in June 2019 but its sales volume was low in 2019. The gloves biodegrade 10 times faster than conventional ones but have a similar shelf life. (Biodegradation of the gloves will only happen in landfills with the help of microbes but not under normal storage conditions.)
2. Sales volume increased 9.2% y-o-y to 53.3 billion pieces of gloves in 2019. Nitrile gloves sales have been increasing consistently year after year (see chart below). However, Top Glove incurred losses in the vinyl gloves segment in China as its sales volume decreased by 29% between 2018 and 2019 due to the oversupply of vinyl gloves. This loss was also caused in part by the fall in the average selling price of vinyl gloves from RM14 per carton to RM10 per carton. Executive director Lim Cheong Guan considers vinyl gloves as more cyclical in nature compared to nitrile and latex gloves. As for surgical gloves, though it only contributed to 3% of Top Glove’s sales volume in 2019, it made up 12% of Top Glove’s 2019 revenue as it fetched a higher average selling price than the other glove segments. Overall, Top Glove registered increased sales volume mainly in developed regions whereas sales volume recorded mostly flattish growth or minor contractions in developing regions.
Source: Top Glove 2019 annual report
3. Net profit excluding extraordinary items decreased 16.2% to RM315.5 million in 2019. The decrease was due to the increased cost of the raw material (i.e. natural rubber) used to manufacture Top Glove’s gloves. Top Glove could not quite pass on the increased cost of natural rubber to its customers, especially in the second half of 2019. The management’s bonuses were also cut as Top Glove didn’t perform as well in 2019 compared to 2018. In 2020, the effective tax rate will hover around 15% given that Top Glove has about RM100 million worth of unutilised tax allowances.
4. The number of workers required to produce a million pieces of gloves for Top Glove has decreased by 69.0% from an average of 8.4 since they listed in 2001 to an average of 2.6 workers in 2019. The chairman reckoned that in order for Top Glove to do well amidst the challenging environment, it has to invest in technology, automation, and young talent. Top Glove strives to continue reducing its dependence on manual labour.
5. Top Glove has an annual manufacturing capacity of 70.5 billion pieces of gloves. An additional 11.4 billion and 9.5 billion gloves worth of manufacturing capacity will be added by 2020 and 2021 respectively, across Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam. The utilisation rate of the nitrile glove manufacturing plant stood at 97%. On a separate note, Top Glove aims to expand its existing distribution network, that currently covers home improvement retailer MR.DIY, to include 99 Speedmart and mini-markets as well.
6. The condom segment posted a revenue of RM34,000 and loss after tax of RM1.8 million in 2019 as a result of start-up costs and a low utilisation rate. The registration processes of condoms across countries take time as they are categorised as a higher-risk classification product. Top Glove has filed for and will receive registration of its condom products within the next two years from various bodies and countries. It has received trial orders so far and has started exporting to Asia, Africa, Middle East, and Europe. The revenue contribution from condom sales is expected to be negligible given the existing robust glove sales as well as future expansions in glove production capacities. On a side note, the maximum revenue contribution from condoms is 20% in order to remain shariah-compliant.
7. Aspion Sdn. Bhd. contributed 10.2% of Top Glove’s revenue in 2019. Aspion’s net profit margin was low initially due to some impact on its business operations.  This was caused by the removal of Aspion’s former director after Top Glove took legal action against vendors for fraudulent misrepresentation and a low utilisation rate. Some shareholders voiced their concerns that Aspion’s net profit of RM10.2 million is markedly distant from its profit guarantee of RM108.3 million in 2019. The management is of the view that no impairment is required after assessing the recoverable amount of Aspion. Management also urged shareholders to take a long-term view in terms of its synergistic relationship with Top Glove. A shareholder joked that he was waiting for the impairment to be made so that he could buy the shares at a depressed price.
8. Value Add Sdn. Bhd. is in the business of property letting and recorded a loss of RM9.9 million in 2019 compared to a profit of RM22.8 million in 2018. Dr Lim attributed the sharp decline to unrealised forex impact as the property was funded through U.S. dollar borrowings. The dollar strengthened against the ringgit by 2.8% in 2019 compared to 2018.
9. Minority Shareholder Watch Group pointed out that Azrina Arshad was appointed as a non-executive director on the day her father, Tan Sri Arshad Ayub — who had been on the board of Top Glove, retired. The directors explained that Azrina Arshad’s working experiences in the architecture field and rapport with various authorities would guide Top Glove in terms of its factory expansion plan. She was hired based on merit and her keen interests in environmental, social, and governance matters are useful to the company’s path to sustainability.
10. The chairman expects the entire rubber glove industry to grow at an annualised rate of 10%. According to the chairman, the rubber glove industry has been consolidating for the past 30 years. Only about 20% of the 250 rubber glove companies in the past survived the intense competition.
11. A shareholder asked for the reasons for buybacks and the resale of treasury shares. Lim answered that the treasury shares were acquired back in 2014 and 2015. Part of the treasury shares were resold to generate internal cash flows. The remaining treasury shares were used as part of the share grant plan for employees to create a form of ownership and loyalty to the company.

Top Glove's upcoming 2QFY20 results could be better q-o-q/y-o-y. Earnings could be even stronger in 2HFY20, driven by the COVID 19-led demand and margin expansion on tight supply situation.
We raise our FY20E EPS by 9% and maintain FY21-22E. Our Target Price is raised to MYR6.65 (+18%) on a higher CY21 P/E target of 34x (from 31x), being its +1.5 SD to 5-year mean.
Top Glove deserves to trade at +1.5 SD to mean because of its robust near-term earnings growth and defensive appeal.
Maintain BUY.
2QFY20E: Better Q-o-q and Y-o-y
Top Glove's 2QFY20 results is scheduled to be released on 19th Mar. We expect net profit to be better q-o-q/y-o-y (1QFY20: MYR111m, 2QFY19: MYR106m) on:
volume growth of 5-8% q-o-q on capacity growth of 10%;
stable margins as latex glove ASP was raised to offset the higher latex cost (+5% q-o-q) and minimum wage hike (+9% in Jan 2020).
Meanwhile, nitrile glove ASP was stable as the lower NBR cost offset the minimum wage hike.
2HFY20E: Stronger Sales and Margin Expansion
Top Glove’s sales orders have doubled in the past 4 weeks. However, due to the worker constraint, we expect the sales volume to grow at a more moderate pace of 5-10% q-o-q in 3QFY20. Its plant utilisation rate rose to 90% (from 85% in 2QFY20) and the sales lead time has extended to 60 days (from 30-40 days).
For 4QFY20, its sales volume may grow another 5-10% q-o-q with the commencement of the new lines at F2B and F5A (+5% to total capacity by mid-2020). We also expect its margins to expand in 2HFY20 given the tight supply and higher plant utilisation rate.
Raise FY20E EPS by 9%, Maintain FY21-22E
Our FY20E EPS is raised by 9% as we nudged up our ASP by 2%. We project a supernormal EPS growth of 33% for FY20E and to contract by 1% in FY21E.
Though glove demand may fall when COVID-19 subsides, we think some of the new demand created by COVID-19 may stay. Developing countries, which have low rubber gloves penetration rates (e.g. China), may raise the regulatory standards for the gloves used at the hospitals/clinics, potentially resulting in rubber gloves displacing vinyl.
Strong Glove Demand Globally
In the past 4 weeks, Top Glove’s sales orders doubled and the additional orders were from almost all of its existing customers - China/HK, Singapore and Italy accounted for 20%, 8% and 6% of the additional orders. The strong demand is driven by COVID-19 and production disruption at China.
We also understand that the initial demand from China was mostly for the latex gloves (potentially due the lower price) and subsequently spilled over to nitrile gloves due to the tight latex gloves supply presently.
However, we caution that Top Glove’s sales volume would grow at a more moderate pace of 5-10% q-o-q in 3QFY20 (slower than the sales orders). This is because the production is constrained by the shortage of workers and capacity.
Presently, Top Glove’s plants are running at a higher average utilisation rate of 90% (from 85% in 2QFY20) and the sales lead time has lengthened to 60 days (from 30-40 days), implying strong sales in 3QFY20.
For 4QFY20, we think its sales volume may grow another 5-10% q-o-q with the commercialisation of the new lines at F2B and F5A in Mar 2020. Upon the full commercialisation by mid-2020, Top Glove’s capacity would grow by 5%.
Given the tight supply environment and higher plant utilisation rate, we also expect Top Glove’s margins to expand in 2HFY20.
In our earnings model, we have assumed for:
sales volume growth of 11%/8%/8% in FY20-22E;
EBITDA margin of 16%/15%/15% in FY20-22E; and
USD against MYR of 4.15 in FY20-22E.

Overall sector performance for 2019 was within our expectations, but fell short of the street’s, as profits constituted 94% and 92% of respective forecasts. We are expecting a stronger 2020 (growth of 13.6%), as we believe that the sector would likely benefit from stronger demand arising from Covid-19 and a weak RM against the US$. Maintain Overweight: Top Glove and Kossan are our top BUYs for the sector.
Demand Started to Recover in 4Q19
We believe that 2019 sector earnings, which grew a mere 1.3% yoy, were negatively impacted by both a labour shortage and also weaker demand from the US for the first 9 months of 2019. As manufacturers have started sourcing labour from other countries to mitigate the shortage issue, we see limited downside risk to our capacity growth forecast of 11-12% for 2020 and 2021. The strong earnings growth of 19.5% qoq in 4Q19 is a good indicator that demand from the US has returned, as buying patterns have started to normalise since import tariffs were imposed on China gloves beginning 3Q19, in our view.
Covid-19 Will Have a Positive Impact on Earnings
We are raising our sector earnings forecasts for 2020 by 2-3%, as we are expecting stronger earnings growth in the 1H20 arising from stronger demand due to the outbreak of Covid-19. Our channel checks indicate that the lead time for delivery has increased from the average 30-45 days in early January 2020 to more than 60 days recently (some have guided that their lead time is now at 4 months). With most manufacturers already operating at above 85% utilisation rates, manufacturers should have the flexibility to increase selling prices, which could lead to better margins, in our view.
Being Rational Is Key to Sustainable Growth
Despite the recent surge in demand for rubber gloves, manufacturers are sticking with their current expansion plans, where we expect total capacity by the Big 4 to increase by 11-12% in 2020. We believe that manufacturers will continue to act rationally, as the current surge in demand may not be sustainable, and a significant increase in capacity over current levels might lead to an overcapacity in the following years. The average demand growth for rubber gloves is around 6-8% a year. Historically, in years where there is a surge in demand due to a pandemic, a slowdown is expected in the subsequent year, as inventories are worn down.
Still Has Room to Re-rate
The sector is currently trading at around +1SD above its historical mean, but there could be more upside to share prices. Based on our observation, glove stocks have traded +2SD above their historical averages in the periods where there is strong demand for rubber gloves (supply disruption or pandemic). We are keeping our Overweight call on the sector, as we believe that the improving prospects (strong demand and weak RM against US$) could lead to a further re-rating of the sector. Top Glove and Kossan are our top BUYs for the sector.

Demand prospect remains positive supported by higher volume arising from Covid- 19 as well as margin resilience on greater manufacturing and cost efficiency.
We estimate sector earnings to grow c.18% in CY20 and valuations raised to +1SD to reflect the enhanced earnings growth moving forward. Upgrade to OVERWEIGHT
Kossan is our top pick due to undemanding valuation and superior profit growth.
Glove universe under coverage earnings within expectation
Overall, 4QCY19 results for glove companies were in-line with our estimates, recording stronger qoq earnings growth mainly due to increased sales volume c.6-13%. We believe demand for Malaysian-produced gloves have improved in 4QCY19 with elevated buying patterns especially from US (partly due to tariff hike on China glove and flu season). The gloves sector has outperformed the KLCI with share prices of all stocks appreciating more than 10% YTD following stronger qoq earnings performance and potential benefits from Covid-19 outbreak, in our view (Chart 1). Star performers were Top Glove (+21%) and Kossan (+15%) due to their strong earnings and improved margins.
Outlook: Better CY20 earnings amidst Covid-19 outbreak
Unabated worldwide spread of Covid-19 with more countries affected and new hotspots emerging namely South Korea, Italy and Iran have led to the WHO advising the world community to beef up their healthcare supplies. Given the uncertainty as to when this outbreak could be contained, worldwide glove demand is expected to spike and remain strong for the immediate future. Global demand for gloves increased by average 12% during SARs and H1N1 outbreaks. As for long-term outlook, the virus outbreak is set to generate greater global healthcare awareness especially in emerging countries. Together with ongoing automation and cost efficiency efforts, these would benefit glove manufacturers in sustaining their long-term growth. Additionally, softening ringgit against USD would also benefit glove players.
Change in earnings forecast
During the period, we raised our utilisation rate assumption for glove companies under our coverage to 85-90% (versus 80-85% previously) for FY20-21 to factor in higher demand arising from Covid-19 outbreak. Consequently, the average earnings FY20-21 for companies in our coverage increased by 3-8%. Upside risk to our forecast, is faster-thanexpected higher demand caused by prolonged and worsening outbreak especially in developed nation. Our sensitivity analysis indicates that for every 1% change in volume would impact our earnings estimates by 1-1.5%.
Upgrade to OVERWEIGHT on the sector
We upgrade our sector call to OVERWEIGHT from NEUTRAL as we expect higher earnings performance on rising demand and better margins. Overall, we estimate earnings growth of c.18% in CY20 (vs CY19: +3%). We have raised our PE valuation to +1SD above 5-yrs historical forward mean to capture the surge in future earnings. Sector valuation is elevated, trading at 31.7x forward PE, above its 5 years mean (refer chart 7). We have a BUY call on Kossan (TP: RM5.70), Top Glove (TP: RM6.30) and Supermax (TP: RM1.95).
Kossan is our Top pick. We like Kossan due to its strong earnings growth of c.21% in CY20 (vs peers average at c.18%) on the back of build-up in demand and improved margin. Additionally, the stock is currently trading at 24x forward PE which is relatively more attractive compared to its peers Hartalega (40x) and Top Glove (30x) as well as trading c.25% discount to average sector peers.
Prospect of rising demand likely to support valuations
Moving from the past several quarters of lacklustre demand, glove industry is now seeing restocking activities being ramped up as the Covid-19 outbreak enforces higher hygiene standards. Based on past experience involving SARS and H1N1, glove industry had shown higher sales volume and margins which led to improved earnings by circa 8-30% qoq during the period. Valuation for individual glove stock as well as sector had risen above +1SD forward PE during H1N1 period as shown in charts 4 & 5.
We believe rubber glove stocks deserved further re-rating and should trade above +1SD to better reflect rubber glove prospects in anticipation of greater demand and earnings performance as well as constant evolution activities (e.g. automation and cost efficiency) taken to maintain a resilient margin. All in, we have raised our PE valuation to +1SD above 5-yrs historical forward mean (refer table 1).

疫情推升手套需求
联昌研究表示，庭外和解是正面消息，虽然和解金额仅为索偿额的35%，但可让该公司完全专注于业务，消除官司带来的不明朗因素。
此和解金将令顶级手套的负债比从2020财年第二季的0.86倍，降低至0.78倍，收入则不受影响。
该行指出，近期新冠肺炎爆发，顶级手套表示，受影响国家如中国，韩国和意大利的手套订单大增。
该公司也提高售价以转嫁增加的成本，显示供需情况对手套业者有利，这应可反映在顶级手套2020财年第三季起的业绩。
联昌基于手套供需有利及顶级手套作为全球最大手套制造商，将从手套需求上涨中受益，因此将该股本益比估值提高至32倍，随之上调目标价。
肯纳格研究表示，2亿4500万令吉的和解金，低于该公司最初索偿的6亿4000万令吉，但仍属正面，可让这项持续已久的争执告终。
该行指出，手套领域在过去3季盈利成长低迷，2020年将展现稳健成长。过去12个月手套需求不振，该领域将从重新囤货的活动中受惠，因新冠肺炎疫情带动手套需求。
“虽然我们预期丁腈手套需求升高将支撑顶级手套接下来季度的成长，但该集团整体获利面对乳胶手套赚幅低和Aspion复苏缓慢带来的竞争压力。”
商誉恐有减值风险
大马研究则对最新进展持中和看法，虽然这消除了诉讼的不明朗因素，但剩遗商誉将有需减值的风险。
和解金将用来抵销投资成本、减少相关商誉，有望改善该公司的现金水平。
该行将顶级手套2020至2022年财测上调1至2%，以反映现金水平改善。
顶级手套是在2018年7月指控稳大资本董事经理刘振源和黄敬杜（译音）串谋欺诈，让公司以13亿7000万亿令吉“高价”收购Aspion，索偿至少7亿1486万2759令吉。
受此消息带动，顶级手套今日股价走高，闭市报5令吉70仙，全日上涨10仙。

最新进展：
针对顶级手套（TOPGLOV，7113，主板保健股）指控Adventa资本董事经理刘振源和黄敬图（译音）虚假陈述的诉讼案，顶级手套宣布与后者达成和解。
顶级手套与子公司Top Care私人有限公司、Aspion私人有限公司、Adventa资本、刘振源和黄敬图，签署和解协议；Top Care将接收总值2亿4500万令吉的赔偿金。 
行家建议：
我们中和看待这项进展，虽然这消除了诉讼案的不确定因素，但商誉余额的减值风险依然存在。
此外，这笔赔偿金将被投资成本抵消，而相关商誉将相应减少，同时将改善现金流地位。
因此，我们上调今明后财年的盈利预测，幅度为1%到2%。
不过，我们降低公司的投资建议，从“买入”降至“守住”，以及小幅调高合理价至5.82令吉，相等于下财年30倍的本益比。
我们持续看好顶级手套，这是基于公司的拓展计划、积极专注于改善素质和运营效率，以及全球橡胶手套制造商的地位。
不过，今年至今的股价已飙升超过20%，目前在34倍本益比的水平交易，相信已经充分反映价值。

Top Glove announced that it has reached a full and final settlement of RM245m with Adventa parties over the acquisition of Aspion in Apr 2018 for RM1.4bn.
To recap, Top Glove sued Adventa parties for > RM715m for conspiring to defraud it over this acquisition via overstatement and overvaluation.
The settlement amount will lower Top Glove’s current net gearing level to 0.78x from 0.86x as of 2QFY8/20. This will have no impact on its income statement.
A settlement of RM245m on legal actions for acquisition of Aspion
In a recent Bursa announcement, Top Glove said it has settled with Adventa and its directors (Adventa Capital, ACPL Sdn Bhd, Low Chin Guan, Wong Chin Toh and Kwek Siew Leng) over legal actions in respect of its purchase of Aspion from Adventa in Apr 2018. Top Glove will receive RM245m as full and final settlement, with no admission of liability by any party and no liberty to file afresh legal actions.
The settlement value will be nett off against the cost of investment and goodwill, with the proceeds used to pare down its current borrowings. We do not expect any impact on Top Glove’s income statement.
A recap on the acquisition of Aspion
Top Glove acquired Aspion in Apr 2018 for RM1.4bn (RM1.2bn cash and RM137m - 20.5m TOPG shares), valuing Aspion at 16.9x FY18F P/E (based on a net profit guarantee of RM81m in FY18). On 9 Jul 18, Top Glove announced that it had filed a legal suit vs. Adventa to claim > RM715m due to irregularities in Aspion’s balance sheet (overstatement of inventory, plant and machinery by RM74m and acquisition price by RM641m).
Positive news in our view
In our view, this is positive news. While the settlement price is only 35% of the claim amount, this allows Top Glove to focus solely on its businesses and clear any uncertainties surrounding this legal case.
As we nett off the settlement amount from Top Glove’s acquisition of Aspion, the purchase is now valued at 26.8x (based on our FY8/20’s net profit target for Aspion of RM30m), a 9% discount to Top Glove’s current FY20 P/E.
Witnessing a surge in demand for gloves from Covid-19 outbreak
On the recent Covid-19 outbreak, Top Glove stated that it has seen a surge in glove orders from affected countries, such as China, South Korea, Italy and etc. We also gather that it has been able to raise its ASPs to pass on cost increases (labour, etc.), indicating that the sector’s supply-demand dynamics have turned favourable towards glove makers, such as Top Glove. This should be reflected in Top Glove’s results at the beginning of 3QFY20.
Reiterate ADD
We make no changes to our FY20-22F EPS as we have already factored in a lower gearing level in our estimates. We, however, raise our target P/E for Top Glove to 32x (+1.5 s.d from its 5-year historical mean) to factor in the more favourable supply-demand dynamics in the glove sector and Top Glove’s position as the largest glove maker globally to capture the increased demand from the Covid-19 outbreak.
Our ADD call is reiterated. Target Price MYR 6.30.

After many rounds of negotiation and to avoid dragging the legal proceedings any further, all parties have established a common ground to resolve the dispute, whereby Top Glove will recover a sum of RM245m as full settlement and all parties will then drop their respective claims. We view the end of this dispute positively, as the proceeds can help improve Top Glove’s cash position and be redeployed for future expansion. We retain our Outperform call on Top Glove and maintain our TP of RM8.60.
To recap. Top Glove had acquired Aspion back in 2018, with a purchase consideration of RM1.37bn. The acquisition comes with a profit guarantee of RM80.9m and RM108.3m for Aspion’s FY18 and FY19 respectively. In addition to the purchase consideration, Top Glove has also agreed to provide Finessis Incentive, based on the profit brought in from the sale of the Finessis range gloves. However, after discovering the irregularities, Top Glove has launched legal proceedings against Aspion’s former parent company, Adventa Capital Pte Ltd and two directors of Aspion, namely Low Chin Guan and Wong Chin Toh, to recover a grand total of RM715m over fraudulent misrepresentation the Aspion directors had made. Subsequently, both Low Chin Guan and Wong Chin Toh has been removed as Aspion’s directors and Top Glove then gained full control over the management of Aspion.
Finally reaching a settlement. Recall that Top Glove has filed a Mareva injunction against Adventa Capital, Low Chin Guan and Wong Chin Toh for an injuncted sum of RM640.5m previously. The court initially granted an interim Mareva injunction, but it was dismissed by the court after. The Group was thereafter granted an Erinford injunction by the judicial commissioner and the injuncted sum was eventually reduced to RM219.7m. After negotiations between the parties, the long-drawn litigation process between Top Glove and Adventa Capital has finally reached an end as both parties enter into a settlement agreement, whereby Top Glove will receive RM245m as a full settlement and all relevant parties in the dispute will thereafter withdraw all claims. Top Glove should receive the full settlement within 15 days, and the settlement will reduce part of the goodwill recorded in Top Glove’s books. After netting off, the balance of goodwill arising from Aspion’s acquisition should stand at c.RM970m, and the remaining portion will still be subjected to impairment test every year, as outlined in the accounting standards. On a side note, the profit guarantee attached to the Aspion deal will also no longer be valid, considering that now Top Glove has gained full control over the management of Aspion.

The cash proceeds from the settlement will be netted off against the cost of investment and the related goodwill will be reduced accordingly. It will not have any impact to the income statement. TP is RM5.30 based on 32x CY20 EPS. Reiterate MP.
Top Glove, Adventa Capital reach amicable out-of-court settlement. In an announcement to Bursa Malaysia, wholly-owned Top Care Sdn Bhd will receive a total of RM245m as final settlement agreement with the former vendors of Aspion. TOPGLOV has resolved disputes involving its two subsidiaries namely Top Care Sdn Bhd and Aspion Sdn Bhd. The disputes, were related to the purchase of Aspion by Top Care, have been resolved “amicably” with Adventa Capital Pte Ltd, ACPL Sdn Bhd, Low Chin Guan and Wong Chin Toh. This is figure is short of the RM640m claims. However, this latest news is positive as this puts an end to the long-standing dispute. The cash proceeds from the settlement will be netted off against the cost of investment and the related goodwill will be reduced accordingly. The proceeds will improve the cash position of the Company and will not have any impact to the income statement. Recall in July 2018, wholly-owned Top Care Sdn Bhd has taken legal proceedings against Adventa Capital Pte Ltd as well as Low Chin Guan (previous owner of Aspion), Wong Chin Toh and ACPL Sdn Bhd (“ACPL”) vide a writ. In the writ, Top Glove and Top Care claimed for RM640m arising from an alleged conspiracy to defraud Top Care and Top Glove, and fraudulent misrepresentations made by Low Chin Guan and Wong Chin Toh in relation to the acquisition of Aspion Sdn Bhd. Top Glove and Top Care have seeked a Mareva injunction to restrain Adventa Capital from disposing of its assets in Malaysia up to the value of RM714.9m pending disposal of the arbitration at the Singapore International Arbitration Centre. Subsequently Adventa Capital made a counterclaim against TOPGLOV for: (i) losses suffered by Adventa Capital as a result of the Company’s and Top Care’s breach of the SPA and (ii) losses suffered by Adventa Capital as a result of Low’s removal from the management of Aspion. TOPGLOV had in April 2018, completed the acquisition of Aspion Group, a manufacturer and distributor of surgical, medical and medical examination gloves in Malaysia for RM1.37b.
Stage set for recovery in volume growth. The stage is now set for a solid growth in the sector in FY20 following three quarters of anaemic quarterly earnings growth. From a low base due to the lackluster demand of the past 12 months, the sector will benefit from re-stocking activities ramping up demand as the current outbreak of the Wuhan virus enforces higher hygiene standards. However, specific to Top Glove, we are less sanguine on its short to medium-term prospects as we expect the group’s overall profitability to be impacted by competitive pressures from low margins latex gloves and slow recovery at Aspion although these will be cushioned by uptick in nitrile demand.
Maintain MP. Our TP is RM5.30 based on unchanged 32x CY20E EPS (at +1.5SD above 5-year historical forward mean). Although we expect uptick in nitrile demand to anchor growth in subsequent quarters, the group’s overall profitability is facing competitive pressure from low margins latex gloves and a slow recovery at Aspion.
A key upside risk to our call is the better-than-expected margin.

  如果收购了，TOPGLOV（7113）可以买吗？
  目前已手套销售额来说，TOPGLOV 排在全球第一（HARTA则是Nitrile 手套第一），不过SEMPERIT 是不是排在全球第二，我就不知道了，小编觉得是没有啦！等下附上公司medical segment 的营业额给大家看看就知道了～
Source：https://www.klsescreener.com/…/%E4%BC%A0%E9%A1%B6%E7%BA%A7%…
  这个收购了LATEXX 的SEMPERIT AG（Vienna Stock Exchange 上市）目前的 P/E 是负数的，很难估计他的value～
  不过，market cap 倒是比较小，大约是 EUR 275 Million 或1.22 Billion 左右，跟TOPGLOV 比起来差很远啊！
  我们从FY 2018 的SEMPERIT 财报里面可以看到，medical segment 是亏钱的，员工的数字也在减少当中，可能我们本地四大天王都比他好啊！
  不过！我们要探讨的是，为什么TOPGLOV 要收购一家亏损当中的手套公司呢？以我的能力，当然是无法完全理解手套王的想法的，不过我们可以想一下有什么可能性！
  1. 这个完全是谣言，TOPGLOV 并没有要收购LATEXX
2. TOPGLOV 想借此扩充产能，但是他们已经计划在 2021 把70.1 Billion 的capacity 增加至91.4 Billion pieces per annum，在这里已经超过了MARGMA 预测的 8-10% 成长率了，难道他们有办法抢更多市场份额？
3. 想利用LATEXX 目前的厂房来转换生产线的话，我觉得是不合逻辑啦！手套生产线通常一个月会停一天拿来进行维修而已，搬运的话成本是多少？耽误的生产又是多少？
4. 想收购过后，把部分subsidiary 转移，然后由亏转盈再上市，这个我觉得可能性比较大啦

Per its report dated yesterday (13 Feb), Macquarie Equities Research (MQ Research) believes this justifies the premium valuation on Top Glove, reiterating its Outperform rating with a target price that is over 20% higher than Top Glove’s closing price yesterday.
Event
MQ Research hosted a conference call with Top Glove management, which has confirmed that demand remains strong and that the company is seeing higher orders from other countries. Given that most of these orders are to be delivered by February/March, MQ Research expects the strong order flows to be reflected only from 3Q FY20 (March–May).
Impact
Demand remains strong. Management has confirmed that demand for gloves remains strong, having seen other countries increase orders. Order lead times have been longer: latex gloves at 55–60 days (previously 30–40 days) and nitrile gloves at 45 days (previously 30–40 days). Currently, the company’s factories are running at an 85–88% utilisation rate. Hong Kong and China comprise only 4% of group revenue, and thus while MQ Research believes demand should rise there due to the coronavirus epidemic, the contribution might be small compared with the contribution MQ Research expects to see on an increase in demand from other markets such as the United States and Europe (North America and Europe comprise 30% and 32% of group revenue, respectively), which could provide earnings upside risk in coming quarters.
Pricing upside potential. Management acknowledged that during periods of stronger demand, such as with H1N1, the company is typically able to remove the bulk discount, providing upside to realised average selling price (ASP). Any cost increases, eg, the recent increase in the latex raw material price (+8%), would also be fully passed on to customers. MQ Research does not believe the market is factoring realized priced upside into earnings estimates, and thus MQ Research sees upside risk that the company could beat consensus over the coming quarters.
As shown in the table below, while epidemics can cause a spike in short-term demand, normalisation of demand thereafter is at a higher level. This provides longer-term volume upside risk.
Action and Recommendation
MQ Research views rubber gloves as a staple within the healthcare industry, which MQ Research believes justifies the premium valuation on Top Glove. MQ Research reiterate its Outperform rating with a target price of RM7.35, which is based on +1.5SD of 32x price-earnings ratio (PER).

  Recently shareholders of AirAsia Group Bhd (KLSE: AIRASIA) and Atta Global were shocked to learn that key executives in their respect companies were caught up in claims of severe misconduct.
Last week, AirAsia’s name came up in a UK court judgement for a corruption trial involving aircraft manufacturer Airbus SE (EPA: AIR), in which Airbus allegedly bribed two unnamed executives – dubbed as “key decision makers” at AirAsia, by providing some US$50 million in the form of a sponsorship for a sports team owned by the two executives, in exchange for purchasing Airbus aircraft. Shares of AirAsia Group and its sister company AirAsia X slumped after the news broke. Co-founders Tan Sir Tony Fernandes and Datuk Kamarudin Meranum have since relinquished their executive roles while authorities probe the bribery claims.
Separately, Atta Global has suspended executive chairman Ooi Chieng Sim, after he was among eight men charged with drug trafficking at the Magistrate’s Court in Bukit Mertajam. These eight men were accused of trafficking 4,980 grams of methamphetamine at a warehouse by the side of Atta Global’s premises in Perai Industrial Estate. Police seized several of Atta Global’s properties in Penang and luxury cars in connection with its investigations. Share of Atta Global and Heng Huat Resource (where Ooi is also executive chairman) were suspended since January 16.
Accusations aside, the two incidents highlight the importance of having a good understanding of the people running the business, before you buy shares of any company. This is especially crucial in Asia where the majority of listed companies are owner-operated. Managers that are dishonest and incompetent can cause a business to lose value over time, and as investors, you would have suffered massive losses and opportunity costs if you had invested in such companies. How can we then avoid such mistakes? Well, below are five examples of management actions that could potentially undermine a company, and in turn, your investment. 
Excessive compensation package
Be wary of managers who write themselves a big pay cheque when the company is producing mediocre or poor results. In doing so, they are focusing on their own interests (i.e. maximizing their compensation package) at the expense of shareholders.
At the company’s 2018 annual general meeting (AGM), Sapura Energy Bhd’s (KLSE: SAPNRG) chief executive officer (CEO) Tan Sri Shahril Shamsuddin survived a bid by institutional investors to oust him as director and CEO amid unhappiness over this total pay package of RM71.92 million for the financial year ended 31 January 2018. Shahril’s remuneration of RM71.92 consisted of RM7.24 million in fixed monthly salaries (and other emoluments), RM55 million in performance bonuses, RM9.34 million under the defined contribution plan and RM348,000 for benefits-in-kind. To put things in perspective, the company recorded losses of RM2.51 billion for the same year.
Overpaying for acquisitions
In search of growth, managers often turn to business acquisition. In some cases, managers justify paying a high price for synergies that do not materialize. Instead of growth, the company faces problems of integrating the acquisition with its existing business operations. Further, if the acquisition is financed by debt, the company is saddled with unnecessary borrowings.
Shares in Top Glove Corporation Berhad (KLSE: TOPGLOV) plunged in July 2018 after the company announced its acquisition price of surgical glovemaker, Aspion, from Adventa Capital could have been overstated by as much as RM714.90 million. Top Glove claimed that Aspion directors, Low Chin Guan and Wong Chin Toh had conspired to defraud and deceive it unto acquiring Aspion for RM1.37 billion. It took legal action against Adventa Capital, Low and Wong after discovering financial irregularities in Aspion’s balance sheet following the completion of the acquisition three months earlier in April 2018. Moreover since the integration, Aspion has yet to produce a significant profit for the group, at least not up to Top Glove’s expectations.  
Mergers and acquisitions must be considered cautiously. No matter how good a business, if you overpay for it, it could turn out to be a poor investment. It would be too late to have buyer’s remorse once an acquisition is completed.
Dubious related party transactions
In August 2019, Genting Malaysia Bhd (KLSE: GENM) announced that it had signed a term sheet to buy the stake in Nasdaq-listed Empire Resorts from Kien Huat Realty, a company controlled by Genting’s founding Lim family. Minority shareholders raised concerns of earnings erosion since Empire Resorts has been posting net losses since 2015, and the acquisition price of US$129 million implied a premium to book value.
Genting Malaysia defended its decision to invest in Empire Resorts, saying the deal would place the company “in a position to more deeply access the New York market and provide both Genting Malaysia and Empire Resorts the opportunity to compete more effectively in the northeastern US region’s current competitive gaming landscape.” Time will tell if the acquisition was wise and indeed earnings accretive.
Selling utopian dreams
At its core, WeWork is a real estate company that leases long term office space in order to rent it to others in the short term. However, the company presented itself as a “tech company”, and persuaded prospective investors to buy in to its vision of becoming the “largest physical social network in the world” and a company that “elevates the world’s consciousness”. Its chief financial officer, Artie Minson even urged investors to view losses as “investments”, when the company reported a loss of US$264 million in the first quarter of 2019.
Losses can be an inevitable part of starting and growing a business – a fact that is widely understood in the investing community. That said, it is important for a company’s management to be honest and forthright about these losses, and to demonstrate a path to profitability. Don’t let management charm you with unrealistic ideas and take you for a spin.
Toxic work culture
Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE: WFC) was regarded for years as one of America’s best banks. Then, in 2016, its pattern of wrongdoing became public. The bank admitted that employees had opened as many as 3.5 million phantom accounts in customers’ names to meet stratospheric sales goals. It also admitted forcing customers to buy unneeded auto insurance and charging improper mortgage fees.
The scandal has been costly for Wells Fargo. Its CEO was pushed out. The bank has paid more than US$1.5 billion in penalties to federal and state authorities and US$620 million to resolve lawsuits from customers and shareholders.
Three major factors contributed to Wells Fargo’s toxic sales culture: unrealistic and unreasonable expectations, minimal accountability and an atmosphere of fear. In short, Well Fargo’s executives created an environment where the results of hitting sales targets greatly outweighed corporate values of “ethics” and “doing what is right for customers”. Avoid companies with toxic business practices.
VIA perspective
There are several ways you can do your research on management. You can read about your managers in news articles or study their track record from annual reports. You can also listen in on interviews and company earnings calls or even ask management questions face to face in an AGM. And if you spot one or more of these management red flags, reconsider your investment.
To end, we leave you with the wise words of Warren Buffet. He said that “in looking for someone to hire, you look for three qualities: integrity, intelligence and energy. But the most important is integrity, because if they don’t have that, the other two qualities, intelligence and energy, are going to kill you.”

Rubber glove stocks under our coverage have performed well following our upgrade eight months ago. Despite easing off from recent peaks, they remain strong outperformers YTD, led by SUCB (+18%), TOPGLV (+20%) KOSSAN (+13%) and HARTA (+6%). The stage is now set for a solid FY20 following three quarters of anemic quarterly earnings growth. Coming off this low base due to the lackluster demand of the past 12 months, forward earnings growth will amplify as re stocking activities ramp up on the current outbreak of the Wuhan virus which enforces higher hygiene standards. All in, we raised our valuations from +1.0SD to +1.5SD to better reflect rubber gloves players’ prospects in anticipation of restocking activities, resilient earnings and their constant evolution and progress to increase earnings. We have OUTPERFORM calls on HARTA (OP; TP: RM7.00; previously RM6.50); KOSSAN (OP; TP: RM5.90) SUPERMX (OP; TP: RM2.00; previously RM1.75) and TOPG (MP; TP:RM5.30; previously RM4.25). Our Top Pick in the sector is HARTA (OP; TP: RM7.00).
Upgrade our PER valuation to +1.5 SD above historical forward average. With the lackluster demand of the past 12 months behind us, we see re stocking activities ramp-up as the current outbreak of the Wuhan virus enforces higher hygiene standards. All in, we raised our valuations from +1.0SD to +1.5SD to better reflect rubber gloves players’ prospects in anticipation of restocking activities, resilient earnings and constant evolution and progress to increase earnings. Based on historical valuation at peak earnings, rubber glove stocks namely Kossan, Hartalega and Top Glove were trading at between +1.5SD to +2.0SD historical forward mean. We believe rubber glove stocks deserve further re-rating and should trade at their previous peak PER valuations given the following factors:- (i) re-stocking activities ramp-up as the current outbreak of the Wuhan virus enforces higher hygiene standards, (ii) uptick in ASPs as most players are running at high utilization rate of 80-90% since most players have cut back on production following concerns of oversupply in 2019, and (iii) margins expansion emanating from higher ASPs since players have scaled back and slowed down on expansion in 2019.
Potential higher ASPs in anticipation of a surge in demand and moderating supply growth in the past 12-months. Tell tale signs of demand outstripping supply could potentially lead to higher ASPs. Looking at the stable raw material price, ceteris paribus, hike in ASPs is expected to lead to margins expansion. We understand that some players have raised prices in anticipation of higher demand and we also noted the current high 90% utilisation rate for nitrile-centric players which is a stark contrast compared to the lacklustre demand in 2019.
Parallels with the SARS and H1N1 experience? During the SARS crisis, the infection was first detected in November 2002. Between then and February 2003, 5 people had died and over 300 were reported to have fallen ill of SARS in Guangdong province, China. During this period in 2003, Top Glove, Supermax and Kossan Rubber revenue and net profit grew between 15% and 25% while HARTA was only listed in 2008. Similarly, during the H1NI period, net profit grew 10%-20% for rubber gloves players under our coverage.
Stage set for a recovery in volume growth. More importantly, even before the Wuhan virus crisis set in, there were nascent signs of a solid uptick in demand for rubber gloves in coming quarters. 3QCY19 results season indicated a positive recovery in demand and hence volume growth from industry leaders - TOPG and HART. Both players recorded 6% and 14% sequential volume growth, respectively. From our ground checks, demand for nitrile gloves is picking up again with players’ new capacities swiftly taken up. We believe this uptick in demand is turning positive and should be reflected in players bottom-line in subsequent quarters.
Nitrile gloves' market share to gain further momentum with potential 30% growth. Based on our analysis, we expect nitrile gloves to continue growing and expropriating market share from latex gloves. The growth in nitrile segment is evident. For illustration purposes, going forward, assuming nitrile:latex breakdown of 80:20 (current is 67:37) and based on estimated global demand of 308b pieces in 2020 (forecast for 2019 is 300b pieces and assuming 8% growth rate in 2020), this implies nitrile growth rate of 30% or an additional 51b pieces from switching to nitrile gloves.
Our Top Pick in the sector is HARTALEGA. We like HARTA for: (i) its “highly automated production processes” model, which is moving from ‘good’ to ‘great’ as they are head and shoulders above its peers in terms of better margins and reduction in costs, (ii) constantly evolving via innovative products development, and (iii) its nitrile gloves segment, which is booming. Our TP is RM7.10 based on 42x FY21 EPS (between +1.5SD to +2.0SD above 5-year historical forward mean).

With the Coronavirus outbreak, Top Glove has received increase in demand for rubber gloves. The recent OPR cut gave an opportunity for Top Glove to issue a perpetual Sukuk of RM3.0bn. Factory 5A, in Ipoh is on track to commence production by end of thi s month. We take the opportunity to update FY22’s capacity that increases FY22 earnings by 7%. We maintain BUY with unchanged TP of RM6.76, based on FY20 earnings pegged to PE multiple 35x.
We met up with management recently to get some operational updates. Here are some of the key take aways:
Coronavirus. World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the Coronavirus outbreak which started in Wuhan, China in December 2019, a global emergency. Typically, in the event of a disease outbreak, a surge in demand is expected. Previously during the SARS and H1N1 outbreak, the global demand for gloves increased to approximately 15%; for Top Glove, demand of gloves were increased by c.20% during H1N1 outbreak. Recently, this new coronavirus has triggered an increasing demand of gloves from China by 4x; however Top Glove’s export to China is miniscule (1QFY20: c.4% of sales volume). Closer to home, Singapore has increased orders by 20x during period of CNY to date (1QFY20: 0.6% of sales volume). Fortunately, Top Glove has not faced any logistical issue (i.e. delays) as we understand healthcare related products gets delivery priority. We also expect stronger demand of latex gloves in the coming 2 months because of this outbreak. However, we choose to remain prudent by keeping pat our demand assumptions, as we can’t ascertain the actual quantum at this juncture and how long it will last.
China factory. Top Glove has 1 manufacturing factory in China, producing solely vinyl gloves. Vinyl gloves are produced with the intention to export it to US. Even though workers are asked to take prolonged leave, we do not feel it will disrupt earnings as vinyl only makes up c. 2% of revenue (1QFY20).
Sukuk. With the recent OPR cut (22 January 2020), Top Glove took the opportunity to issue perpetual sukuk of RM3.0bn in nominal value. The sukuk, which is guided under the Shariah principle of Wakalah Bi-Al has been assigned an AA-IS(cg) rating by MARC. The proceeds raised are intended to be utilised to refinance its existing debt obligations and working capital purposes. Net gearing as at 1QFY20 stood at 86%; assuming an issuance of perpetual sukuk of RM1bn, net gearing is expected to fall to c.34% (perpetual sukuk is classified equity instead of debt). The sukuk is planned to be issued by end month.
Expansion. Newest factory, F5A located in Ipoh, Perak is on track to commence production by end of this month, bringing the number of factories to 34 by 2QFY20. By end of 2020 Top Glove will add c.11.8bn pieces in capacity bringing its total installed capacity to an estimated 81.9bn pieces (+16.8% YoY) with 781 lines in 2020 with the bulk of the capacity to come in the second quarter of the year.
Forecast. We take this opportunity to adjust/update FY22’s capacity that increases FY22 earnings by 7%.
Maintain BUY, TP RM6.76. We maintain BUY with unchanged TP of RM6.76. To recap we changed our valuations on all glove companies under our coverage to +1.5SD in our Strategy report (3rd Feb); Top Glove’s PE multiple was raised to 35x (from 26x), that increased our TP from RM5.02 to RM6.76. We like Top Glove for its diverse product mix and its prime position to chip away market share.

The coronavirus is putting those facilities to the test.
  “We have seen a surge in glove demand, especially from China, Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan,” said Lim, the 62-year-old founder and executive chairman of Malaysia’s Top Glove Corp.
  “Over the past week, the total sales orders received are equivalent to more than double our usual sales to China.”
  The outbreak has killed almost 500 people and spurred a rush for protective gear, with stores running out of surgical face masks and hand sanitizer. Top Glove, which Lim founded in 1991, now expects sales will climb 25% this year, up from an earlier forecast of 10% to 15%.
  Shares of Top Glove have gained 20% this year, lifting Lim’s net worth to $1.1 billion, according to calculations by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, which excludes the value of his pledged shares.
  Malaysian manufacturers supply more than 60% of the world’s gloves and have said they plan to donate 18 million pieces of medical gloves to Wuhan, the epicenter of the crisis where local hospitals are appealing for additional protective medical supplies including masks and suits. Top Glove alone has pledged to donate 3 million pieces, with 1.3 million already shipped,
and Lim said he’s confident it can meet future demand.
  “We are pleased to be in a position to help protect and save lives, and are able to ramp up our glove production to ensure we are able to cater to the surge in demand when the need arises,” he said.
  Alan Lim, an analyst at RHB Research Institute, raised his recommendation on Top Glove to buy from neutral in a Jan. 23 research note, based on expectations for an increase in long-term demand for gloves because of the virus.
  Top Glove isn’t the only gainer. Heightened concerns over the virus have also boosted the shares of Malaysian competitors including Hartalega Holdings Bhd. and Supermax Corp.

  Top Glove Corporation Berhad manufactures and sells natural rubber, nitrile, and vinyl gloves. It is the world’s largest glove manufacturer with 26% of market share globally and aims to grow its market share to 30% by 2020. Top Glove currently has an annual manufacturing capacity of 64 billion pieces of gloves.
Here are 14 things to know about Top Glove before you invest:
1. Top Glove derives most of its sales from its export business to 195 countries. It distributes 20% of its gloves of its own brand directly to end users and through an online platform. Original equipment manufacturing (OEM) gloves contributes to 80% of its product portfolio. Its clients come from various sectors ranging from medical to manufacturing and food processing.
2. Top Glove aims to be a Bursa Malaysia Top 20 company by 2020 and Fortune Global 500 company by 2040. Top Glove is currently a constituent of the FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI that features the 30 largest companies on Bursa Malaysia. However, Top Glove was accused of compulsory labour, excessive overtime, debt bondage, and passport confiscation by The Guardian, and subsequently denied the allegations. The global market is key to Top Glove’s continued growth and chairman Tan Sri Dr Lim Wee Chai believes it’s important to follow the rules when doing business with the U.S. and Europe.
3. Top Glove foresaw that demand for natural rubber gloves would remain stable when it listed in March 2001 as synthetic gloves could not mimic the high elasticity and tensile strength of natural rubber gloves. Despite this, the demand for nitrile gloves has grown considerably. Nitrile gloves overtook latex-powdered gloves as Top Glove’s best-selling glove in 2017.
Source: Top Glove annual reports
The changes are in line with the gradual shift in Malaysian glove exports from natural rubber to nitrile gloves. This is due to some people being allergic to the protein found in natural rubber gloves, which is not ideal for medical practitioners.
4. The glove industry is a largely resilient one. Gloves are a necessity and cannot be reused for hygiene reasons. Global rubber glove consumption grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.0% from 2000 to 2018. Demand is expected to grow moving forward due to increasing healthcare standards, growing and aging populations, and increasing usage in the non-medical sectors.

5. Some of the business risks Top Glove faces include fluctuations in raw material prices, foreign exchange rates, and utility costs. In the face of competition,it cannot fully pass on these cost increases to customers. It was estimated by an analyst that Top Glove could only pass on between 50% to 80% of cost increases.
6. Top Glove chairman, Tan Sri Dr Lim Wee Chai, his wife, Puan Sri Tong Siew Bee and his brother, Lim Hooi Sin are among the company’s board of directors. The chairman’s son is also part of the senior management. They collectively own a 35.8% stake in Top Glove as of October 2019. It is good to see the founder and management having some ‘skin in the game’ as this aligns them with shareholder interests.
7. Top Glove relies on a two-pronged approach to grow — organic and inorganic growth. In terms of organic growth, its annual manufacturing capacity rose massively from 3.2 billion pieces in 2001 to 64 billion pieces in 2019. For inorganic growth, Top Glove has looked at mergers and acquisitions as well as ventures into related industries ranging from rubber plantations to medical catheters, which the chairman thinks ‘is not rocket science’. The chairman views a company of Top Glove’s size needs to diversify in order to grow further.
8. Top Glove set aside RM30 million to invest in a new condom manufacturing factory to produce OEM and own brand condoms. The rationale for the investment is its attractive profit margins and valuations. In the chairman’s opinion, the condom industry also uses similar raw materials, production processes, and marketing strategies as the glove industry. Top Glove aims to grab a 5% share of the global condom market but will face hurdles as evidenced by Karex Berhad‘s — the world’s largest condom producer with 15% of global market share — recent challenges in condom supply overcapacity and government funding cuts.
9. In April 2018,  Top Glove acquired Aspion Sdn Bhd from Adventa Capital Pte Ltd for a total of RM1.4 billion. Of which, RM1.2 billion was settled via a combination of internally generated cash and loans, while the rest was satisfied via a rights issue. Three months later, Top Glove discovered irregularities in Aspion’s balance sheet and claimed that the inventory, plant, and machinery as well as acquisition price were overstated by RM74.4 million and RM640.5 million respectively. As a result, Top Glove sued Adventa Capital and its directors, Low Chin Guan and Wong Chin Toh, for RM714.9 million. Litigation is still ongoing as of December 2019. After the news, Top Glove lost RM3.8 billion or 24.6% of its market capitalisation in one day. An extraordinary general meeting was subsequently held to remove Low from the board of Top Glove. The chairman said Top Glove would be more careful with its future mergers and acquisitions but not be deterred from making additional acquisitions to fuel its growth agenda. In my opinion, Top Glove needs to improve its capital allocation and due diligence in order to preserve shareholder value.
10. Top Glove ended up 2019 in a net debt position of RM2.3 billion. It took on debt to acquire Aspion and fund its ongoing expansions. Its total-debt-to-equity ratio stood at 0.95 as at 31 December 2019. The chairman has stated that Top Glove can still continue to acquire other companies as long as the gearing is below 1.0. A ratio below 0.5 may be more ideal for more conservative investors.
11. Revenue has grown at a CAGR of 21.8% over the past 19 years. In 2o19, revenue grew by 13.8% year-on-year because of robust sales growth of nitrile gloves. Revenue has increased every single year except for 2011, 2o13, and 2014. In 2011, the U.S. dollar weakened against the Malaysian ringgit, which impacted Top Glove’s revenue which is reported in U.S. dollars. Top Glove was affected by higher raw material costs the same year. In 2013-2014, the average selling price of gloves fell due to heightened competition which affected revenue.

12. Net profit excluding one-off items is slightly choppy over the same period but increased at a CAGR of 18.2%. In 2019, net profit dropped 16.2% year-on-year because of higher rubber prices, competition, and losses in the vinyl segment. The drop in net profit in 2011, 2013, and 2014 was due to the same reasons mentioned above. Higher raw material prices also impacted Top Glove negatively in 2017. It has good quality earnings as its cash-flow-to-net-income ratio is at 1.2 over the past 19 years. Its ROE has averaged at 16.3%, which is above the benchmark of 15.0% we normally look for.

13. Top Glove has the second highest EBITDA margin and the third highest EBIT margin among Malaysian glove manufacturers. The top four companies in the table below are sometimes collectively known as the Big Four by the media. (Malaysia is the largest glove exporter and producer with 63% market share in 2018.)
Name EBITDA Margin EBIT Margin
Hartalega 22.9% 19.4%
Top Glove 13.5% 9.5%
Kossan Rubber 13.2% 9.6%
Supermax 11.4% 8.5%
Comfort 12.0% 9.0%
Careplus 8.4% 2.2%
Rubberex 15.2% 9.4%
14. Overall, dividend per share has been on an upward trend, which is good news for income investors. Top Glove has a dividend policy of distributing not less than 50% of its net profit to shareholders each year.

The fifth perspective
Being in the right growth industry, Top Glove is almost a 100-bagger if an investor invested in the stock from its listing in 2001, which is impressive. Along with Hartalega, Top Glove looks set to benefit from the rising global demand in gloves. However, investors need to watchful of its debt level and the quality of acquisitions moving forward.

The recent virus outbreak is expected to drive demand growth for rubber gloves for the year, with earnings growth for glovemakers likely to be stronger in the coming quarters.
Macquarie Equities Research (MQ Research) has a more positive view on the Malaysian rubber glove sector amid the coronavirus outbreak, with Top Glove being the top pick with its target price increased to RM7.35 and Hartalega upgraded to outperform.
Event
MQ Research has a more positive view of the Malaysia rubber glove sector from neutral to overweight. Earnings growth is likely to be strong in coming quarters due to supportive demand growth from Coronavirus and the US influenza season. MQ Research estimates new demand would result in a shortage of 10.8bn pcs in 2020. The strong expected quarterly earnings into 1Q/2QCY20 period onwards should rerate the stocks to +1.5SD price to earnings (PE). MQ Research’s top pick is Top Glove with a higher target price of RM7.35.
Impact
Coronavirus drives rubber glove demand. Coronavirus took only 1.5 month to reach more than 16,000 infections, faster than SARS and H1N1. WHO declared Coronavirus a global health emergency on 30-Jan. MQ Research expects the fear for coronavirus to continue to increase demand for rubber gloves globally as other countries step up their preparedness for the further outbreak. To-date, based on MQ Reserch’s checks all the top five manufacturers have received urgent orders from China and HK and the orders are quite sizeable.
US flu season also increase glove demand. United States is experiencing one of the worst flu seasons in five years. Percentage of medical visits for influenza like illness continues increasing (Fig 9). The US practice is to use medical gloves during entire care for a patient. Demand from the US flu season is expected to increase until April/May, the typical period of low flu activity.
Expect a glove shortage in 2020. MQ Research expects Coronavirus and the US flu season to drive global demand growth at 13% y-y. As a result, MQ Research estimates the market will experience a shortage of 10.8bn pcs in 2020. Pricing power will likely start to tilt towards manufacturers and lead to a margin expansion.
Valuation spike ahead. MQ Research sees sector PE multiples to increase as a result of the improved earnings outlook due to strong demand driven by Coronavirus and the US flu season. MQ Research’s analysis of earnings and share prices shows a strong correlation of glove producers’ share prices and their earnings. MQ Research expects disease-driven demand will only reflect in 1Q/2Q CY20 results, as most of the orders are delivered in Feb onwards.
Outlook
MQ Research has a more positive view of the glove sector, as the Malaysian glove players are benefitting from the ongoing Coronavirus and the US influenza outbreak. MQ Research’s top pick is Top Glove, which has the most capacity addition in 2020E and biggest beneficiary of Coronavirus, with an increased target price of RM7.35 (from RM4.97). MQ Research also raises its target price on Hartalega to RM7.10 (from RM4.05) and upgrade to Outperform from Underperform. With the strong demand, both companies are poised to deliver stronger quarterly earnings in 1Q/2Q CY20.

However, taking into account previous epidemic outbreaks and our base assumptions, valuations appear to have fairly priced in the incremental demand impact on sector earnings.
We lift our 2020-21 sector net profit forecasts by 16% and 11% to factor in our higher volume growth assumptions. We raise our valuations to reflect the enhanced earnings growth going forward.
Maintain MARKET WEIGHT. Top pick: Kossan.
What’s New
Outbreak spreads but WHO stops short of an international emergency classification.
Coronaviruses are a group of viruses that cause diseases in mammals. The virus has sickened more than 2,700 people in China, with more than 80 reported deaths. The new coronavirus was temporarily named “2019-nCoV” and has already spread to more than 10 countries, across 4 continents. Recently, the World Health Organisation (WHO) met on 25 January but stopped short of declaring the 2019-nCoV virus a public health emergency of international concern, a declaration used for the gravest of epidemics.
The absence of evidence of human-to-human transmission outside of China and unprecedented measures to rein in the spread of the virus in China has held back WHO officials from assigning 2019- nCoV the highest possible threat classification. WHO officials are due to reconvene this week. The previous pandemics, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and H1N1 were eventually declared as global emergencies but on varying timelines.
TIMELINE OF PREVIOUS PANDEMICS - SARS & H1N1
SARSH1N1
  First suspected human infection 16 Nov 02 15 Apr 09
WHO declares international public health emergency 12 Mar 03 25 Apr 09
Approval of drug vaccine/discovery of genetic sequence of virus - important to treatment and prevention efforts 14 Apr 03 15 Sep 09
WHO announces outbreak was contained/end of pandemic 5 Jul 03 11 Aug 10
From first human infection to vaccine discovery or treatment breakthrough 5 months 5 months
From first human infection to WHO declaring containment 8 months 16 months
Impact Infected: 8,096 Deaths: 774 *Hospitalised: 60.8m Deaths: 151,000 – 574,000
* Mid-range of estimated impact from Apr 09 to Apr 10
Using preceding H1N1 outbreak to measure 2019-nCoV’s impact.
We look at the previous outbreaks to determine the possible impact 2019-nCoV could have on the glove sector. That said, back in 2003, the SARS outbreak and the glove industry were still under-developed.
Fast forward to 2009, H1N1’s outbreak had a pronounced impact on the sector. Sector volume grew in excess of > 20% against higher economies of scale and better demand-supply imbalance; profit margins improved to 14.5% from 10.5% in the four quarters after and before the H1N1 outbreak. Incremental demand for hospital care and by proxy, medical grade gloves appear to be dependent on the extent of the epidemic outbreak, infection rate and time taken to discover a vaccine.
Sector earnings enjoyed three quarters of enhanced growth after vaccine discovery.
Based on H1N1’s first suspected infection, it took two quarters for incremental demand to significantly impact glove sector earnings. Following which, there were three quarters of extraordinary q-o-q profit growth between 3Q09 and 2Q10. This is in spite of a vaccine discovery on 15 Sep 09. Only after 2Q10 did top-line see q-o-q growth and profit margins started moderating.
Valuations tracked sector earnings, not vaccine discovery.
In terms of valuations, it peaked to 17.8x one-year forward PE (or > +1 SD of 16.3x) in Jul 10. Peak valuations coincided with peak sector earnings in 2Q10. However, we note that valuations continued to rally well past the approval of the drug vaccine as there was a gestation period for containing the H1N1 outbreak. This had a delayed impact to earnings.
However, it is apparent that valuations traced sector earnings and not the vaccine discovery. Subsequent to the containment, valuations tumbled as the glove industry had a surplus of gloves.
Essentials
It has been close to a month since China alerted the WHO of several unique cases of pneumonia. As of 28 January, there were close to 4,000 people infected with the coronavirus. To adjudge the impact on glove players, our base assumptions for the 2019- nCoV factors in the timeline midpoint between SARS and H1N1, assuming a timeline of 12 months before WHO declares a containment.
Timeline.
Based on the H1N1’s time lag effect on earnings, exhaustion of inventory and existing delivery lead times of between 45 to 50 days (potentially up to 60-70 days), we imagine incremental demand driven by the new coronavirus could be reflected in 2Q20. The time span of “supernormal profit” depends on vaccine discovery and extent of the pandemic. However, our base case assumes two quarters of “supernormal profit”.
Glove volume growth and earnings assumptions.
Based on the assumptions above, we raise our industry volume growth assumption from 10% and 9% in 2020 and 2021 to 15% and 12% respectively. Broadly, we upgrade sector earnings forecasts by 16% and 11% for 2020 and 2021 respectively.
Action
Maintain MARKET WEIGHT.
The recent coronavirus outbreak has certainly rerated valuations. Based on our base case, we expect incremental demand for medical grade gloves to significantly impact earnings by 2Q20 and enhanced earnings could be sustained for three quarters should the H1N1 outbreak be a comparable measure.
Apart from raising sector earnings, we raise our PE valuations to +1SD from the mean PE peg that we previously applied to glove producers to capture the surge in earnings based on our base assumptions. Sector valuations are elevated, trading at 29.4x PE, slightly above +1SD to the PE mean of 28.8x. This is backed by an expected surge in two-year earnings CAGR of 18.5% over 2019-21.
The exciting growth appears fairly priced in by elevated valuations. Top pick for the sector is Kossan.
Vaccine discovery may be too premature for profit-taking.
Depending on the severity of the outbreak, profit-taking upon discovery of vaccine may be too premature. During H1N1, valuations continued to climb 9 months after vaccine discovery, in tandem with q-o-q profit growth.
We believe a more reflective measure is potential shortening of delivery lead times and decline of infected cases as potential red flags to waning demand. Apart from that, potential peak valuations that we have highlighted may be indicative of a sell trigger as it factors in +2SD valuations against aggressive incremental demand.
Kossan Rubber Industries (BUY / Target Price: RM6.22).
Maintain BUY but with a higher target price of RM6.22 (from RM4.70) as we raise our 2020-21 earnings forecasts by 17% and 10%. We also lift our PE peg to 26x 2020F PE (from 23x) to factor in the attractive earnings growth (2-year earnings CAGR of 20% over 2019-21).
Over time, the outpaced earnings growth relative to its peers, coupled with consistent execution, should reinvigorate Kossan’s valuations. The potential re-rating should narrow its discount to Top Glove and Hartalega which we think should be trading at 28.5x and 32.5x PE respectively.
TOP GLOVE CORPORATION (HOLD / Target Price: RM6.05).
Our target price is lifted to RM6.05 from RM4.50 as we raise FY20-21 earnings forecasts by 18% and 14% based on a higher 28.5x 2020F PE (from 25x). (Using the latest FX rate of 1RM to 0.3329SGD, we derived target price of 2.01 in SGD term.) We factor in the incremental demand ripple to earnings. Aside from that, the company could be in the best position to benefit, given its excess capacity on latex glove production.
We believe Top Glove’s premium of 28.5x or +1SD to the sector PE mean is fair given it is a component in the FBMKLCI Index and therefore deserving of a slight premium to the sector. Entry price is RM5.50.
Hartalega Holdings (SELL / Target Price: RM5.32).
Our new target price is based on a higher 32.5x 2020F PE (from 29x) and enhanced earnings forecasts of +13% and +8% for FY21-22 respectively. The premium can be justified by its strong operating efficiency and innovation ahead of peers. Nevertheless, our bearish call is premised on Hartalega’s lofty valuation (39x 2020F PE) which limits potential price upside.

Although there has yet to be any spike in glove demand arising from the latest incident (human-to-human transmission), we believe this would help raise the awareness for the need of a proper protection barrier for medical professionals. Maintain Overweight, with Top Glove and Kossan as our top picks for the sector.
Share Prices Sensitive to Outbreak
Although the share-price performance for the rubber glove manufacturers tends to react positively on the news flow of virus outbreaks (either pandemic or epidemic), share prices also correct subsequently, as the incremental real demand varies from case to case. Nonetheless, we believe that news about an outbreak is good for the sector (demand) in the long run, as it helps to raise the awareness for the need of a protection barrier for medical professionals. It was reported by some news sources that 15 Chinese medical workers were infected with the coronavirus.
Who Will Benefit the Most?
As most manufacturers are already operating at close to their optimal utilisation rates (close to 90%), a sudden surge in demand will likely push ASPs higher, which will lead to an improvement in the manufacturers’ margins. We believe that Top Glove (BUY) is likely to benefit the most as the company is only operating at around 85%. However, it is still too early to determine whether the current outbreak would spur demand similar to SARS in 2002/03. China currently accounts for 2% of Malaysian rubber glove sales, but the incremental sales (if any) are more likely to arise from the other regions, which could be impacted by the spread of the virus. Thailand, Japan and South Korea have reported confirmed cases of the coronavirus.
What to Look Out For?
The WHO will make its decision on Wednesday as to whether to declare the current outbreak as an international public health emergency similar to what they did with the swine flu and Ebola. We believe that there could be a potential spike in glove demand if the current outbreak is declared a pandemic or epidemic. However, our current Overweight call on the sector is not dependent on the incremental demand from this outbreak. We are expecting stronger earnings growth in CY20E, supported by stronger demand and a recovery in profit margins.

We think the ongoing coronavirus could develop into a global pandemic outbreak. Top Glove (SGX:BVA) is the biggest beneficiary given its fastest capacity growth and relatively lower plant utilisation rate. No change to our earnings forecasts for now.
We made the following changes:
Top Glove - raise to BUY (from HOLD) with a higher Target Price of MYR5.65 (+19%);
Kossan – maintain at BUY with a higher Target Price of MYR5.30 (+9%).
Maintain Hartalega at HOLD with an unchanged Target Price of MYR5.75.
Possible Sustained Human-to-human Transmission
The coronavirus has infected a total of 5 countries (China, Thailand, Japan, Korea, and US) and there is also a suspected case in Philippines. A total of 300 cases and 6 fatalities were reported. According to World Health Organisation (WHO), the new Coronavirus may have sustained human-to-human transmissibility. Yesterday, it was reported that 15 medical workers at Wuhan have been diagnosed with coronavirsus.
May Develop Into a Pandemic Outbreak
Though the major airports have already tightened their screening measures, we note that the screening may not be able to pick up all the infected patients as the incubation period of the virus (between contracting of the virus and the onset of symptoms) is 6-10 days. Hence, we see high possibility of the coronavirus developing into a global pandemic outbreak.
Top Pick: Top Glove
We believe the potential pandemic outbreak may spur global demand for gloves. During SARS (2002- 03) and H1N1 (2009-10), the global demand jumped by an average growth rate of 13%. In our stock universe, we think Top Glove would be the biggest beneficiary given its fastest capacity growth of 18% in CY20 (Kossan: 11%, Hartleaga: 9%) and relatively lower plant utilization rate of 85% (Kossan: 85%, Hartalega: > 90%).
We raise Top Glove to BUY (from HOLD) with a higher Target Price of MYR5.65 (+19%) as we raise our P/E target to 31x (from 26x; being its +1SD to 5- year mean) and also roll forward valuation to CY21E.
We keep Kossan at a BUY with a higher Target Price of MYR5.30 (+9%) as we roll forward our valuation year to CY21E (still based on unchanged 24x P/E target, +0.5SD to 5-year mean).
Hartalega remains a HOLD with unchanged Target Price of MYR5.75 as it is already based on CY21E P/E target of 37x (+0.5SD to 5-year mean).

So far, six people were reported dead while more than 300 people were infected, with worries mounting as millions begin travelling for Chinese New Year celebrations.
While demand has yet to surge, Macquarie Equities Research (MQ Research) believes this will likely prompt glove distributors to start stocking up; Top Glove and Supermax are likely to be the biggest beneficiaries in terms of sales volume.
Event
China has confirmed human-to-human transmission of the coronavirus, and the virus has spread to more China provinces and other countries in Asia. While rubber glove manufacturers have not yet experienced a surge in orders, MQ Research believes the worsening situation in China could lead to higher overall glove demand.
Impact
China has confirmed human-to-human transmission of coronavirus. The virus has spread from Wuhan to Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen, as well as other countries in Asia (currently one case in Japan, two in Thailand and one in Korea). Experts indicate the ability of the virus to spread and adapt to the population is similar to the way Sars developed in its early stage and has evoked memories of the outbreak of Sars – also a coronavirus – that killed nearly 700 people in 2003 after originating in China.
What was demand during the H1N1 virus outbreak? During the H1N1 outbreak in 2009, glove manufacturers experienced a peak utilisation rate of 90–95%. As a result, overall glove export volume jumped 14% YoY in 2010 along with the surge in overall global demand for rubber gloves.
Demand yet to surge, but this could happen anytime soon. MQ Research’s checks show glove manufacturers have not yet seen a surge in glove demand on the back of the virus outbreak. MQ Research believes Chinese buyers have increased demand of cheaper vinyl gloves in the first instance. If the outbreak is prolonged, there could be a spill over to rubber gloves. The upcoming travel period around the Lunar New Year holiday could spark an acceleration of the outbreak and spur global glove demand.
Who will be the biggest beneficiary? Glove manufacturers are running close to an optimal utilisation rate of 85%. Thus, any spike in demand could tilt the pricing power back to the manufacturers. MQ Research believes manufacturers with the highest exposure to the Asia market and with the highest capacity additions could be the biggest beneficiaries in terms of sales volume from this virus outbreak. Among glove manufacturers, Top Glove has the highest capacity additions, while Supermax and Sri Trang have strong exposure to the Asia market.
Outlook
Of MQ Research’s covered stocks, MQ Research prefers Top Glove over Hartalega due to its wider product mix, diversified market exposure as well as the potential benefit it could see from this virus outbreak. Nonetheless, Hartalega could also benefit if customers in developed countries (Europe and United States) start stocking up on rubber gloves as a preventive measure. MQ Research’s blue-sky valuations for Top Glove and Hartalega are RM7.50 and RM7.10, respectively.

（吉隆坡21日讯）中国武汉爆发新型冠状病毒肺炎疫情，不仅开始蔓延到其他国家，也已证实会人传人，分析员认为，预料将使全球市场对医疗保健提高警惕，长期有助推高胶手套需求，顶级手套（TOPGLOV,7113,主板医疗保健组）等4大手套股受到青睐而价量齐扬，齐发“灾难财”。
顶级手套一度涨34仙
顶级手套今日开市起2仙，以4令吉82仙报开后，即受到投资者追捧，最多一度涨34仙或7.05%至5令吉16仙。
最后以5令吉11仙挂收，全天起29仙或5.81%，共3327万9900股易手，显示交投相当旺热。
贺特佳一度升27仙
贺特佳（HARTA,5168,主板医疗保健组）也不甘示弱，股价一度涨升27仙或4.86%至5令吉82仙高峰，闭市报5令吉80仙，涨25仙或4.68%，成交量直逼千万股，达1464万3800股。
高产柅品一度扬27仙
高产柅品（KOSSAN,7153,主板医疗保健组）一度涨27仙或6.38%至4令吉50仙。虽然未能以最高收市，全天仍起24仙或6.10%至4令吉47仙，成交量放大至737万2400股。
速柏玛一度起15仙
速柏玛（SUPERMX,7106,主板医疗保健组）被炒起而价量齐升，一度升15仙或11.45%至1令吉46仙全天最高，较后涨势收窄，全天仍14仙或10.69%至1令吉45仙。成交量达5639万3200股，为全场第四热门股，热络程度罕见。
世界卫生组织（WHO）证实，中国武汉爆发新型冠状病毒，这是较为广泛的病毒种类。这项新的变型冠状病毒已传至其他国家，包括泰国发现有2宗病例，日本及韩国各有1宗。
中国中央电视台报道称，截至当地时间周一下午6时，中国共确诊217宗新型病毒感染病例，其中198宗在武汉。
引起这次肺炎疫情的病毒与2002年爆发的沙斯（SARS）同样属于冠状病毒株。SARS疫情也是首先出现在中国，在2002至2003年爆发期间造成全球8098人受传染及774人死亡。
世卫表示，这种新型冠状病毒疫情最可能源自“动物”，而且密切接触人群存在一些“有限的人传人”现象。
世卫将在周三召集一个紧急专家委员会会议，评估中国爆发的这次疫情是否构成国际卫生紧急状况，以及应该采取哪些措施。
截至目前，世卫尚不建议采取任何旅行或贸易限制措施。不过由独立专家组成的一个委员会可能提出这种建议，或者其他限制疫情蔓延的建议。
长期警惕传染病
新兴市场手套需求有增无减
联昌研究指出，长期而言，这种传染病毒事件，将导致更高卫生保健警惕，特别是新兴市场，从而将刺激胶手套需求。预料胶手套公司盈利前景有望改善，因获得更好供应与需求活力支持。
联昌研究看好高产柅品及顶级手套，因它们为表现落后的胶手套股，相信它们的股价比同侪如贺特佳的估值盈利差距将缩减。该行认为，顶级手套及速柏玛是这波传染病毒肺炎的最大赢家。
联昌研究表示，顶级手套及速柏玛拥有额外产能，特别是胶手套产品领域，之前此领域价格压力较高使工厂使用率较低。该行认为，长期而言，目前爆发的新传染冠状病毒将对医疗健引起更高的警惕，特别是新兴市场，从而推高胶手套需求。
根据该行查询，该行研究名单下的胶手套业者，尚未因发生新传染病毒，而使胶手套需求剧增。这可能是新传染病毒事件尚落在初步阶段，同时中国每人使用胶手套的比例不高，因为它的医疗保健意识比先进国低。
该行认为，若传染冠状病毒持久及成为全球性的传染病，预料全球市场对胶手套的需求才会剧增，就像之前所经历的2003年的沙斯病毒以及2009年的禽流感事件。预估2003及2009年的全球胶手套需求增加12至16%，比较2009至2019年是每年增加7至9%。
该行指出，目前大马胶手套业者的平均工厂使用率已达到逾85%，任何胶手套产品需求将推高胶手套的赚幅，因它们的产能有限。
联昌研究指出，该行对胶手套行业维持“加码”评级，首选胶手套股为高产柅品及顶级手套，目标价分别为5令吉21仙及5令吉22仙，皆为“买进”评级。

活动：股东大会
日期：1月8日（星期三）
时间：上午10时30分
地点：沙亚南顶级手套大厦
●年报重点
顶级手套（TOPGLOV,7113,主板医疗保建组）已占有全球26%的手套市场份额，通过掌握先进市场和新兴市场尚未开发的机会，集团短期内的目标是：提高市场份额至30%。
为了确保集团有充足的能力，应付全球市场对手套的迅速需求，集团维持每年增建1至2间工厂的目标及寻求更多协同并购机会。与此同时，集团正寻求扩大产品机会，以涉足更专业的手套及非手套产品，例如止血带（压缩绷带）、导管和其他医疗设备。
此外，集团将通过工业4.0，对研发、自动化及数字化进行投资，以提升集团的制造业流程、营运效率，集团新建的制造业设施，将利用先进的技术，同时将对现有工厂进行升级，以优化生产过程。
放眼成500大企业

对集团来说，2019财政年是丰收年，并达成许多里程碑，集团坚信将迎来更美好的未来，继续取得更理想的业绩。远大目标是：放眼在2040年之前，实现进入世界财富500大企业，集团将致力所设定的目标。
2019财政年是充满挑战的一年，不过顶级手套营业额持续增长，并取得48亿令吉的新高，主要是丁腈手套市场强劲增长，手术手套市场增长46%。美国和日本市场的销售量，分别增长20.3%和24%。在日本，使用量由医疗领域扩大至餐饮等行业，带动手套需求量。
不过，集团净盈利下跌15.2%，至3亿6754万6000令吉，主要是乳胶价格上涨、天然乳胶手套的竞争市场及PVC手套市场蒙受亏损，因而盈利无法超越2018年的表现。
推出旗舰绿色产品为了彰显承诺，顶级手套成立一个永续发展委员会，负责推动工作，以便集团在这个重要的领域中取得进展。此外，集团也推出旗舰绿色产品，可降解无粉丁腈手套，与传统的丁腈手套相比，这绿色手套的降解速度至少快10倍。
展望未来，集团对顶级手套及手套业前景乐观，市场对手套需求保持强劲，以集团对质量、自动化及流程改进的措施，相信在未来财政年将取得更好业绩表现。

On a CAGR basis, TOPGLOV has grown 16.11% based on 5 years. The increase in revenue was mainly due to robust growth in sales volume of nitrile gloves segments which saw a 30% surge, enhanced the marketing efforts as well as additional nitrile capacity which has increased by 54% over the past 2 years, with the plan for further expansion. (Source: Annual Report 2019).

The increase in gross profit was mainly attributed to 46% jump in volume sold for surgical glove segment which largely due to the contribution from Aspion and increases in demand for nitrile glove segment, which sales volume go up by 20.3% and 24% respectively chiefly by US and Japan. (Source: Annual Report 2019)
 
The Net Profit After Tax (PAT) of TOPGLOV has decreased 15.16% from RM433.2 million in FY2018 to RM367.5 million in FY2019. The decreased in Net Profit After Tax (PAT) was mainly due to the increase in latex concentrate prices, competitive environment for natural gloves as well as the losses occurred in the vinyl segment due to oversupply in China.

Cash Flow Statements
The net cash from operating activities has obtained a positive cash flow of RM526.2 million in FY2019 compared to RM341.2 million in FY2018 indicates that the company is healthy and have enough cash used for business expansion.
The net cash from investing activities in FY2019 is (-RM493.5 million) was mainly due to purchase of property, plant and equipment (RM568.1 million), purchase of land use rights (RM55.6 million), purchase of intangible assets (RM0.016 million), additions to investment property (RM0.393 million), purchase of investment securities (RM138.4 million), an increase in the bank balance pledged with banks (RM1.1 million).

Prospect and Challenges
The domestic rubber sectors are expected to be a bounce-back in FY2020, as the US buyers will be likely to increase the Malaysian shipments as well as 15% additional tariff imposed on medical gloves made in China, effective from 1 Sep 2019. (Source: The Malaysian Reserve, 17Dec2019). The expected robust growth is underpinned by an expanding of the global healthcare sector as well as increased awareness of the importance of hygienic practices throughout the industry, especially the emerging markets such as India and China. (Source: TheEdge, 12Dec2019).
TOPGLOV will be in expansion mode as there is an influx of latex glove supply from Thailand-based Sri Trang Agro-Industry Pcl aims to increase the rubber glove output by about 74% to 30 billion gloves annually by the end of FY2020 from 22 billion in the nine months of FY2019. (Source: TheEdge, 12Dec2019).  TopGlove also has date established a total of 4 R&D Centres staffed by some 454 researchers (as at FY19) from across varied fields of expertise, working together to drive innovation and breakthrough at Top Glove. (Source: Annual Report 2019).
TOPGLOV has set aside about RM100 million for land acquisition in the country would be used for setting up the factories to produce vinyl gloves. TOPGLOV also will open its first Vietnam factory to meet a surge in demand for the hygienic gloves. As the construction of the plant has started in Vietnam, it is done deal there and the operation would commence in the first quarter of 2020. (Source: Daily Express, 21Mar2019).
In the year-end of FY2019, TOPGLOV has carried out large scale line modification, key process improvements as well as intensive training for factory floor personnel. They are also pleased to report that there is no impairment loss required for the provisional goodwill arising from the acquisition of Aspion as at 31Aug2019. (Source: Annual Report FY2019).

Rating System
Return on Equity (ROE) = Average
Revenue [5 years CAGR] = Good
Net Earnings [5 years CAGR] = Average
Basic Earnings per Share [5 years CAGR] = Average
Interest Coverage = Average

My Insight
Based on my calculation on Discounted Earnings Model, TOPGLOV has a fair value of RM8.40. The current market value of TOPGLOV is RM4.77 which is undervalued (Based on 23Dec2019). TOPGLOV has a beta of 1.020 (500 days) indicates that the company is more volatile than the current market, which means the investors/traders are actively trading in this stock, they may face a higher risk. Based on my computation of Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR), TOPGLOV has an expected market return of 6.27%.
In conclusion, Top Glove Corporation Bhd has achieved an outstanding performance for revenue in FY2019 due to the robust growth in sales volume of nitrile gloves segments and capacity of nitrile segment expansion. Even though the Profit After Tax has slightly decreased in FY2019, I still believe that the company is well-positioned to tap on the growing glove demand and prioritise R&D, innovation and Industry 4.0 initiatives.

不过，分析员仍认为手套股具稳健的增长和盈利具抗跌性。
达证券指出，尽管今年第三季需求正常化后，本地主要4家手套公司盈利按季增长7.6%，但激烈竞争下首9个月累积盈利仍下滑了13.7%。
面对中泰业者竞争
该行认为，今年至今大马手套领域充满竞争，主要受到贸易战、泰国或中国日益激烈的竞争、中国乙烯基手套生产复苏、天然气费涨价、最低薪金调高和劳工问题的逆风。
贸易战导致俩大国关税和全球经济增长的不稳定，一些顾客采购时都有所保留或是减少数量。
再加上劳动短缺的问题，一些手套制造商削减了生产力，从而导致上半年大马手套出口下跌了4.5%。
不过，达证券相信，该行业在2020年的增长质量和防御性将保持不变。
该行预计，明年全球橡胶手套需求将按常年增长10%，至3300亿只，而大马将以贡献约2080亿只或63%稳站全球最大橡胶手套生产国，紧接着则是泰国18%、中国的10%及贡献3%的印尼。
手套出口明年有望反弹
大马胶手套厂商协会（MARGMA）预测，明年该领域出口总值将反弹至2070亿令吉，今年预测为1820亿令吉。
中长期而言，随着新兴市场如非洲和亚洲的医疗保健监管逐渐严格，将进一步刺激该领域增长。目前欧美的手套消耗量超过人均100只，相等于亚洲人均5只的20倍以上。
大马主要4家手套商预计明年将贡献新增需求（300亿手套）的59.7%或179亿只，这与该行预测的63%比重或189亿只非常接近。
此外，该营运环境下较小的制造商仍努力保持竞争力，该行业可能进行着整合。
而泰国诗董橡胶预计持续其积极扩展计划，明年提高50亿只至300亿只产能，借此继续主导乳胶手套的价格，以提高市场份额。
丁腈手套需求明年料增180亿只
明年丁腈手套需求预计增180亿只，占胶手套新增需求60%。
首4家本地手套制造商将扩展丁腈手套产能246亿只，该行预测，平均利用率约70%和制造商交错扩张下，该4家业者明年将增售152只，满足丁腈手套新增需求84%。
虽然美国对中国医用手套加征15%加征关税促使大马在美国销量增长8%，不过随着中美达成第一阶段，征收的关税将降至7.5%。
与此同时，中国也将手套倾销至欧盟市场，导致大马在该市场份额下滑。
大马手套业者没受惠贸易战
再加上，顾客防御态度和中国手套平均售价偏低加重重拾市场难度，大马制造商想调高平均售价并不易。
综合上述，达证券预计，大马手套业者无法在贸易战中取得显著的好处。
原料价格部份，达证券表示，随着2019年天然乳胶价格波动，全球天然橡胶生产商减少出口44万1648公吨，远高于原本预期下砍24万公吨。
再考虑到部份橡胶园的橡胶树受真菌病危害导致产量减半，该行预计接下来乳胶接下来平均价格将介于每公斤4令吉40仙至4令吉80仙（首9个月平均价4令吉52仙）。
丁腈橡胶价格则将维持目前水平，首9个月平均售价每公斤1令吉零7仙。
马币方面，该行预测2020年马币兑美元为4.10，并预见若马币每走高1%，手套制造商盈利将潜在下跌0.8%。
近日大马人力资源部宣布全国57个乡城将调高最低薪金制至1200令吉，大部份手套厂均在该范围内。
该些制造商有意转嫁增高的成本，加上需遵守严格的劳动合规措施如加班时长也将推高成本，大马胶手套厂商协会预测手套价格将提高约10%。
整体而言，该行维持对该领域的评级，而下行风险是全球贸易战持续。

最近开始有留意手套股，
主要是因为TOPGLOV的业绩开始表现不错，
和HARTA和TOPGLOV的股价开始突破200MA以上，
相信读者也开始问手套股是不是可以买进了，
那么应该买那一只呢？
今天夜月就来分析一下目前手套行业的状况，
和4只手套股当中，
哪一只的趋势比较强？
  首先我们来谈一谈手套行业整体的状况，
利好是来自于中美贸易战，
美国对中国手套实施的关税，
导致美国商家开始转向大马的生产商，
所以需求增加了，
暂时解除了供应过剩的问题。
但是还是有以下几点需要留意，
第一 PE值过高
第二 最低薪资上涨和欧盟的强制劳工法令
第三 4大手套商公司的扩展导致手套售价遭到压制。
    接下来我们以技术面的方式，
来分辨一下4大手套商目前趋势的强度。
第一名 KOSSAN
KOSSAN股价在今年5月多的时候就成功突破200MA，
目前200MA已经开始向上，
股价也稳定在200MA之上，
算是目前趋势相对于稳定。
    第二名 HARTA
HARTA股价在9月成功突破200MA以上，
虽然当中有经历几次回调，
但是都没有跌破200MA，
近期有开始往上突破的趋势，
有可能是因为KLCI受到WINDOW DRESSING的影响。
    第三名 TOPGLOV
TOPGLOV之前一度受到跌出KLCI的风险，
跟着富时罗素排KLCI成分股的规则，
只要成分股的市值跌破第35名以下，
就有机会被除名，
目前TOPGLOV算是安全，
目前是34名。
TOPGLOV的股价是因为这次业绩亮眼而上涨，
目前已经突破200MA以上，
所以算是第三名，
接下来就看它能不能站稳了。
    第四名 SUPERMX
目前唯一还没有突破200MA以上的就是SUPERMX，
所以基本上不会考虑趋势最弱的这家公司，
毕竟行业抓的就是趋势，
趋势强的股会越来越强，
趋势弱的股会越来越弱。
  总结来说，
目前4只手套股的趋势来说，
个人比较偏向KOSSAN和HARTA，
KOSSAN趋势强PE低，
HARTA龙头股盈利率高，

Total sales volume increased 6% q-o-q while Aspion contributed positively to earnings.
Capacity expansion plan remains intact.
Maintain HOLD with higher Target Price of RM4.25.
1QFY20 Results Within Expectations
TOP GLOVE registered a net profit of RM111.4m in 1QFY20 (+1.2% y-o-y; +39.2% q-o-q), accounting for 25% of our full-year forecast, which is within expectations.
No dividend was declared in 1QFY20 as usual.
Better earnings q-o-q and y-o-y.
The q-o-q and y-o-y improvement was mainly driven by higher contribution from the nitrile glove segment. Net margin improved to 9% in 1QFY20 compared to 7% in 4QFY19, thanks to the upward revision in selling price for nitrile gloves and 6% increase in total sales volume.
Aspion also positively contributed to the earnings. It registered PBT of RM5m in 1QFY20 (vs loss before tax of RM4m in FY19) due to continuous improvement in production efficiency and quality as well as upward revision in selling price.
Weaker ASP y-o-y.
The average selling price (ASP) for natural rubber and nitrile in USD terms were weaker y-o-y in 1QFY20. Nitrile raw material prices were weaker y-o-y at RM4.34/kg (-17.6% y-o-y, -1.4% q-o-q), while natural rubber latex prices were higher y-o-y at RM4.13/kg (-11.0% q-o-q).
Better EBIT/k gloves q-o-q.
EBIT/k gloves came in at RM10.42, improving significantly q-o-q by 32.0% but this represents an 11.0% y-o-y decline. The q-o-q improvement of EBIT/k was mainly due to the higher selling price and sales volume for nitrile gloves. However, the weaker EBIT/k y-o-y showing was due to the impact of natural gas hike from Jul 2019.
Shift in production mix: higher nitrile volumes.
In 1QFY20, nitrile gloves accounted 49% of total sales volume which increased from 42% in 4QFY19. On the flipside, latex powdered glove only accounted for 20% of total sales volume (vs 27% in 4QFY19). The switch to nitrile gloves from latex powdered gloves is due to stronger demand for nitrile gloves resulting from latex allergies. This trend is expected to continue in the future.
Lower effective tax rate in 1QFY20.
Effective tax rate was lower at 10.8% in 1QFY20 (vs 16.0% in FY19) due to tax incentive and recognition of deferred tax assets. The tax incentive is coming from new subsidiaries that enjoy reinvestment allowance and tax allowance.
Earnings lifted on lower tax and gas tariff.
We adjust our FY20-22 net profit upwards by 2.5%, 2.2% and 2.1% respectively to factor in lower effective tax rate and lower gas tariff. This is partially offset by higher labour cost from an increase in minimum wages.
Outlook
Capacity expansion.
In its latest update in Dec 2019, the total installed capacity stands at 70.1bn pieces of gloves. The capacity expansion plan remains intact where F7A and F2B refurbishments are expected to commercialise in 1QCY20. Other expansion plans for CY20 include Factory F5A, Factory F40, Factory F41 (Vietnam), and Factory F8A (Thailand). These expansions will add capacity of 11.8bn gloves p.a. for CY20, raising Top Glove’s annual capacity to 81.9bn pieces at the end of CY20 – representing a 17% increase from the current installed capacity of 70.1bn pieces.
For CY21, Top Glove aims to hit a capacity of 9.5bn pieces of gloves. We have incorporated management’s capacity expansion guidance into our FY20-21 earnings forecasts.
Focus on digitalisation and automation to save costs.
In the medium to longer term, management will embark on digitalisation and automation efforts via the Industry 4.0 framework involving the application of Internet of Things (IoT), robotics and automated real-time manufacturing systems. This is to reduce the foreign labour reliance and improve the efficiency of the manufacturing process.
Valuation
We maintain our HOLD call with higher target price of RM4.25.
Following our earnings adjustment, we lift our Target Price to RM4.25 (from RM4.05), based on 23x CY20 EPS. We maintain our HOLD call as it is trading at a rich valuation of 32.1x FY19 PE, above +1.0x SD of its 5-year mean PE or above +2.0SD of its 10-year mean. Using the latest FX rate of RM1 to SGD0.3274, we derive target price 1.39 in SGD term. of
We believe the good results on strong sales volume has priced in.
A key re-rating catalyst for Top Glove would be a faster-than-expected recovery for its subsidiary Aspion.

Top Glove reported a net profit of RM111.7m in 1QFY20, up 50.1% QoQ and 1.2% YoY. Meanwhile, quarterly revenue stood at RM1209.1m, +1.7% QoQ but -4.2% YoY.
Within our expectation and consensus. 1QFY20 net profit accounts for 28.0%/26.0% of our/consensus full year estimates.
Comments
Flattish YoY performance. Top Glove’s revenue came down 4.2% YoY due to lower selling price of nitrile (-8% YoY) and latex (-3% YoY) amid marginally higher sales volume (+0.2% YoY). The Group’s operating profit decreased 11.4% YoY because of higher natural gas price (+6% YoY), natural rubber latex (+9% YoY) and fierce competition in natural rubber glove segment. Hence, 1QFY20 profit before tax went down to RM125.5m (-11.6% YoY). Still, the group recorded marginally high YoY net profit to RM111.7m (+1.2%) because of lower tax expenses (-54% YoY) pertaining to tax incentives.
Commendable QoQ result. The Group recorded positive gain for revenue (+1.7% QoQ), operating profit (+46.6% QoQ), and net profit (+50.1% QoQ). This were largely contributed by strong sales volume growth from higher margin of nitrile gloves (+12% QoQ), profit margin expansion of higher natural rubber glove average selling price, USD appreciation against RM (+0.5%), lower raw material prices (natural rubber -11% QoQ) and (nitrile latex -2% QoQ), coupled with narrowing losses from vinyl glove segment. Also, better results from Aspion underpinned the overall bottom line.
Expansion plans are on track. The Group will continue its expansion of existing facilities and the construction of new facilities, which will boost the total production line (+178 lines) and production capacity (+21.3b/30.3%) by end of 2021. Hence, the Group is projected to have 861 production lines along with a total production capacity of 91.4b per annum. Notably, 6 out of 8 new plants will be setting for nitrile glove with approximately extra 130 lines of production cum 16.2b capacity.
Stabilizing raw material prices. Average latex concentrate prices continued their downward trend by falling 11% from RM4.64/kg in 4QFY19 to RM4.13/kg during 1QFY20. Looking forward, we believe this will persist in the subsequent months as Thailand has been pushing more natural rubber exports in this calendar quarter. Meanwhile, average nitrile latex price was at USD1.06/kg, down 14.5% YoY. This is likely to continue, albeit at a slower pace, as supply shortage problem diminished. We are looking at softening natural gas price, probably will be reduced by 2.96% in 1H2020.
Risks include: 1) USD falling moderately against MYR, 2) Price war (i.e. nitrile segment), 3) Sluggish sales from Latin America and 4) Labour shortage.
Earnings Outlook/Revision
We revise upward our FY20F earnings forecasts by +17.5% to RM465.4m as a result of higher operating margin. We also introduce our FY21F net earnings of RM 534.1m. Our net profits for FY20F and FY21F represent growths of 26.6% and 14.8% respectively.
Valuation & Recommendation
Maintain HOLD with a higher target price of RM4.73 (previous target price of RM4.67) after our earnings upgrade. Our revised target price is now pegged at 26x FY20F PER, which is at 3-year historical mean PE on the back of brighter outlook in respect of resilient glove demand and favorable raw material prices moving forward.

Top Glove (TOPG) reported a decent set of numbers: 1QFY20 corePATAMI of RM111.4m (+39.2% qoq; +1.2% yoy) is slightly ahead of our but within consensus estimates, delivering 26% and 22% of the respective forecasts. The improvement in earnings can be attributed to the higher sales volume and the recovery in margin, as competition in the latex segment has eased. We are expecting stronger quarters ahead, with new capacity expected to start contributing in 2HFY20. Reiterate BUY and raise our TP to RM5.40.
Easing Competition Is Good for Top Glove
We believe that the recovery in margin was due to the price increases on the natural latex gloves that were initiated by TOPG in 4QFY19. Although sales volume for the latex gloves is still down by 14% yoy, we believe that the overall competition has eased, as the sales volume has remained stagnant qoq. Nevertheless, latex powder-free gloves are up by 1% yoy or 6% qoq, which we believe is a positive indicator that competition has eased somewhat, at least among the Malaysia players. Sales volume for the latex powdered gloves continued to decline by 6% qoq.
Nitrile Segment Going Strong
We are expecting stronger quarters ahead, mainly driven by the stronger demand for TOPG’s nitrile gloves, as sales volume is up by 20% yoy (or 12% qoq). Due to the surge in sales volume, utilisation rates for TOPG’s nitrile lines are at 97%. TOPG was able to meet the increasing demand, as the new Factory 32 (2.2bn + 1.2bn) has started contributing. Despite facing labour shortage issues, TOPG was able resolve the situation by recruiting workers from Nepal, Indonesia and Myanmar. As such, we are not expecting any delays to its current expansion plan.
Reiterate BUY With a Higher TP of RM5.40
We have tweaked our EPS for FY20E by 3.7% due to the lower effective rate guidance and therefore raise our 12-month TP to RM5.40 based on an unchanged 31x PER (+1SD) on our FY20 estimate. Top Glove remains one of our Top BUY picks for the country and sector.

TOP GLOVE's 1QFY2020 results were above ours and consensus expectations due to low tax rate. Sequential earnings could be slightly lower due to the rising latex cost.
We raise our FY20-22E EPS by 10-13%, mainly to impute for the lower tax. Consequently, our Target Price is raised to MYR4.75 (+11%), on an unchanged 26x CY20F P/E (10% discount to our target P/E for Hartalega (HART MK, SELL, Target Price MYR4.95). Maintain HOLD.
Our preferred pick is Kossan (BUY, Target Price MYR4.85) for its exposure to the non-medical segment and undemanding CY20E P/E of 22x.
Above Expectations
Top Glove's 1QFY20 net profit of MYR111m (+39% q-o-q, +1% y-o-y) was 28%/26% of our and street’s full-year estimates. Results were above our expectation due to the low tax rate of 11% (vs. our assumption of 20%).
Given the available tax incentives, management has guided for its tax rate to be 13-15% in FY20F.
1QFY20: Stronger Q-o-q But Weaker Y-o-y
Q-o-q, 1QFY20 net profit rebounded (+39% q-o-q) on:
higher sales volume (+6% q-o-q) as the strong nitrile sales volume (+12% q-o-q) more than offset for the weaker latex powdered sales volume (-6% q-o-q);
higher EBITDA margin (+3.5-ppt q-o-q) on lower raw material costs (latex: -11% q-o-q, NBR: -2% q-o-q).
However, on a y-o-y basis, PBT was dragged by the weaker latex gloves given the structural demand shift to nitrile and competition. Additionally, the gross margin of latex gloves was around 2- ppt lower than that of nitrile.
Raise FY20-22F EPS by 10-13%
Some of its latex powdered lines have been converted to nitrile powdered lines. Coupled with the new capacity, nitrile is now its biggest revenue contributor (c.52% of total revenue).
We also note that it has reduced its planned new capacity for CY20 to 11.8b pcs p.a. (18.2b pcs p.a. previously), which may alleviate a potential supply overhang in 2020.
We raise our FY20-22F EPS by 13%/10%/10% as we:
lower our assumed tax rate to 13% (-7-ppt);
increase the sales volume of the higher margin nitrile gloves by 2% p.a.

Within expectations. 1QFY20 revenue of RM1,209.1m (+1.6% QoQ, -4.2% YoY) brought core PATMI to RM107.6m (+32.2% QoQ, +11.6% YoY) after removing forex gain of RM3.8m. The results came within both ours and consensus expectations, at 23% and 25% respectively.
Dividend. No dividends were declared during the quarter under review.
QoQ. Revenue increased (+1.6%) thanks to stronger sales volume (+6%), especially from the nitrile glove segment with 12% increase. Natural rubber glove segment too contributed marginally positively (Latex powder free: +6%, Latex powdered: -6%), as the effect of the upward revision in ASPs took effect as well as downward trend in the price of latex. EBITDA margin improved by 3.6 ppts to 15.4% due to lower NR prices (-11% to RM4.13/kg) and NBR prices (-1.8% to USD1.06/kg). Subsequently, core PATMI improved by 32.2% to RM107.6m (from RM81.4m).
YoY. Revenue declined (-4.2%) to RM1,209.1m (from RM1,262.0m) caused by lower ASPs despite higher sales volume (+0.2%). Nitrile glove segment thrived, with stronger sales volume (+20%), however this was offset by weaker contributions from natural rubber (-14%) and vinyl (-30%) glove segments. Nitrile glove segment improvement was helped by enhanced efficiency from technological advancement, automation and digitalisation initiatives. EBITDA margin declined slightly by 0.2 ppts due to mixed raw materials prices; higher NR prices (+8.7% to RM4.13/kg) and lower NBR prices (-14.5% to USD1.06/kg). Lower effective tax rate of 10.8% (FY19: 16.0%) was due to tax incentives and recognition of deferred tax assets. All in, core PATMI increased (+11.6%) to RM107.6m (from RM96.4m).
Capacity expansion. In 2020 Top Glove will add c.11.8bn pieces in capacity bringing its total installed capacity to an estimated 81.9bn pieces (+16.8% YoY) with 781 lines in 2020 with the bulk of the capacity to come in the second quarter of the year. Furthermore in 2021, Top Glove will be adding c.9.5bn pieces more in capacity (+11.6%).
Outlook. Top Glove will continue to invest line refurbishment and building new technologically advanced glove factories as well as diversifying into rubber or healthcare related business. Top Glove plans are also in progress to establish its Manufacturing and Research Centre of Excellence; new state-of-the-art hub for R&D and product innovation based in Banting.
Forecast. Our FY20-21 earnings decrease by 2-4% due to model upkeeping in tandem with the release of FY19 annual report. We introduce our FY22 estimates.
Maintain BUY, TP: RM5.01. We maintain our BUY call, with a lower TP of RM5.01 (from RM5.02). Our TP is based on FY20 earnings pegged to a PE multiple to 26x. We like Top Glove for its diverse product mix and its prime position to chip away market share.

Top Glove’s (TG) 1QFY20 PATMI increased by 50% qoq to RM111.4m due to strong growth in sales volume (+6% qoq), higher nitrile glove ASP (+2% qoq) and lower overall operating expenses. Average price of raw material fell qoq (NR: -11%; NBR: -1.8%). On yoy basis, PATMI increased slightly by 1.2% despite a dropped in revenue (-4% yoy), mainly due to lower effective tax rate of 10.9% (-10.4 ppts yoy).
Key highlights. Total sales volume increased by 6% qoq and 0.2% yoy mainly driven from higher sales of nitrile glove (+12% qoq, +20% yoy). Sales mostly came from developed market, up 11.5% qoq (refer table 3).

EBITDA margin improved by 3.6 ppts to 15.4% due to lower NR prices (-11% to RM4.13/kg) and NBR prices (-1.8% to USD1.06/kg). Subsequently, core PATMI improved by 32.2% to RM107.6m (from RM81.4m).

YoY. Revenue declined (-4.2%) to RM1,209.1m (from RM1,262.0m) caused by lower ASPs despite higher sales volume (+0.2%). Nitrile glove segment thrived, with stronger sales volume (+20%), however this was offset by weaker contributions from natural rubber (-14%) and vinyl (-30%) glove segments. Nitrile glove segment improvement was helped by enhanced efficiency from technological advancement, automation and digitalisation initiatives. EBITDA margin declined slightly by 0.2 ppts due to mixed raw materials prices; higher NR prices (+8.7% to RM4.13/kg) and lower NBR prices (-14.5% to USD1.06/kg). Lower effective tax rate of 10.8% (FY19: 16.0%) was due to tax incentives and recognition of deferred tax assets. All in, core PATMI increased (+11.6%) to RM107.6m (from RM96.4m).

Capacity expansion. In 2020 Top Glove will add c.11.8bn pieces in capacity bringing its total installed capacity to an estimated 81.9bn pieces (+16.8% YoY) with 781 lines in 2020 with the bulk of the capacity to come in the second quarter of the year. Furthermore in 2021, Top Glove will be adding c.9.5bn pieces more in capacity (+11.6%).

Outlook. Top Glove will continue to invest line refurbishment and building new technologically advanced glove factories as well as diversifying into rubber or healthcare related business. Top Glove plans are also in progress to establish its Manufacturing and Research Centre of Excellence; new state-of-the-art hub for R&D and product innovation based in Banting.

Forecast. Our FY20-21 earnings decrease by 2-4% due to model upkeeping in tandem with the release of FY19 annual report. We introduce our FY22 estimates.

Maintain BUY, TP: RM5.01. We maintain our BUY call, with a lower TP of RM5.01 (from RM5.02). Our TP is based on FY20 earnings pegged to a PE multiple to 26x. We like Top Glove for its diverse product mix and its prime position to chip away market share. Furthermore with the US-China trade war making China gloves more expensive, this could shift some demand towards Malaysian gloves.

The positive variance from our forecast is due to better-than-expected volume sales. As such, we raise our FY20E and FY21E net profit by 5% each. Correspondingly, we also upgrade our TP from RM4.00 to RM4.25. Reiterate UNDERPERFORM.
1QFY20 PATAMI of RM111.4m (+39% QoQ; 1% YoY) came in marginally above expectations, at 28%/26% of our/consensus fullyear forecasts. The positive variance from our forecast is due to better-than-expected volume sales. No dividend was declared as expected.
Key result highlights. QoQ, 1QFY20 revenue rose 2% due to higher sales volume (+6%) but negated by lower ASP (+2%). PBT margin shows a marked improvement 3.6ppts from 6.8% in 4QFY19 to 10.4% in 1QFY20 due to an upward adjustment in ASP for latex gloves and a lower input raw material latex. This brings 1QFY20 PATAMI to RM111.4m (+39%) despite a higher effective tax rate of 10.9% compared to 1.3% in 4QFY19.
YoY, 1QFY20 revenue fell 4% due to lower ASP (-8%) but mitigated by higher sales volume (+0.2%). Volume sales was largely driven by nitrile (+20%) and was offset by lower latex (-14% albeit larger base). PBT fell 12% mainly attributed to a sharp upward movement in the input natural latex price (+9%) and intense competition in the latex segment leading to lower margins which adversely impacted bottom line. Nonetheless, 1QFY20 PATAMI was higher by 1.2% boosted by a lower effective tax rate of 10.9% compared to 21.3% in 1QFY19.
Intense competition in latex more than offset uptick in nitrile demand. Despite better 1QFY20 results, looking ahead, the keen competition in the latex segment could negatively impact latex gloves margin. Although we are positive on growth in subsequent quarters underpinned by uptick in nitrile demand driven by re-stocking activities, the group is plagued with competitive pressure from low margins latex gloves (accounts for estimated 50% of product mix) which could offset the gains in the nitrile segment. The robust demand for nitrile gloves led to longer delivery lead times to between 45 to 50 days as compared to 30 to 40 days previously.
Expansion plans. Top Glove’s capacity expansion includes: Factory 32 (Phases 2 to commence production by 4QCY19; 1.2b pieces), Factory 2B (operational by 4QCY19; 0.8b pieces), Factory 5A (operational by 1QCY20; 2b pieces), Factory F40 (Phase 1 operational by 2QCY20 and Phase 2 operational by 3QCY20; 3.6b pieces), Factory F41 (operational 2CY20; 4b pieces PVC gloves) Factory F42 (operational by 4QCY20; 4.8b pieces), and Factory 8A (operational by 4QCY20 delayed from early 2020; 2.8b pieces) which will boost the group’s total production capacity by 20.2b gloves per annum to 84.1b (+32%).
Upgrade FY20E/FY21E net profit by 5% due to the better-thanexpected volume sales.
Reiterate UP. Correspondingly, our TP is raise slightly from RM4.00 to RM4.25 based on unchanged 25.5x CY20E revised EPS of 16.6 sen (at +1.0SD above 5-year historical forward mean). Although we expect uptick in nitrile demand to anchor growth in subsequent quarters, the group overall profitability is plagued with competitive pressure from low margins latex gloves and a slow recovery at Aspion.
A key upside risk to our call is the better-than-expected margin.

We maintain our BUY call on Top Glove Corporation (Top Glove) with an unchanged FV of RM5.12/share based on a P/E of 27x on FY21F EPS. Our PE multiple is based on the 2-year historical forward PE.
We continue to like Top Glove for its: (1) expansionary plans; (2) focus and continual efforts in improving quality and operational efficiencies; and (3) position as the world’s largest rubber glove manufacturer.
Top Glove’s 1QFY20 net profit of RM111.4mil (+1.2% YoY, 39.2% QoQ) was in line with both our and street’s expectations, accounting for 26.6–26.0% of our and street’s full-year earnings forecasts respectively.
Key highlights of Top Glove’s 1QFY20 results and teleconference briefing are:
Top Glove’s 1QFY20 revenue shrank 4.2% YoY to RM1,209.1mil on the back of a lower ASP. Sales volume inched up by 0.2% YoY in 1QFY20 mostly led by a 20% increase in nitrile gloves sales volume (latex powdered -24%, latex powder-free +1%, vinyl -30% and surgical -5%).
The group said that demand growth for latex gloves has been slow in developing countries in 1QFY20 compared with 1QFY19. We believe sales of latex gloves were also impeded by heightened competition from Thailand’s increasing latex glove production. ASP remained subdued for both nitrile (- 8.5% YoY to US$22.70) and latex (-1.1% YoY to US$18.50) gloves due to increased competition, which has placed downward pressures on selling prices.
The group’s EBITDA fell 5.5% YoY while EBITDA margin slipped 0.2ppt YoY to 16.2% in 1QFY20 (+3.4ppt from 12.8% in 4QFY19). This was largely due to an 8.7% YoY rise in natural rubber price to RM4.13/kg and 6.0% higher natural gas cost. Vinyl gloves also suffered a lower selling price due to increased competition. This resulted in an operating loss of RM1.6mil in 1QFY20 (operating profit of RM1.8mil in 1QFY19).
Margin corrosion from lower selling prices was largely offset by the group’s nitrile glove sales mix which rose to 49% (42% in FY19) as Top Glove’s nitrile gloves command a slightly higher margin compared with latex gloves. The 14.5% drop in nitrile latex price of US$1.06/kg also helped.
 Aspion’s production efficiency, quality and selling price improved in 1QFY20 compared with FY19. It contributed to circa 9.5% and 9.0% to group’s revenue and EBITDA respectively. EBITDA margin improved 6.6ppt to 14.7% in 1QFY20 (8.0% in FY19) due to effective cost controls. Capacity utilisation remains low at below 60%.
Top Glove benefitted from a lower effective tax rate of 10.9% (-9.6ppt from 21.3% in 1QFY19) due to the recognition of deferred tax asset and tax incentives. The group expects effective tax rate to remain low at circa 13–15% in FY20F. Our FY20–FY21F effective tax rate estimates are within this range.
The group’s capacity has expanded by 9.7% since FY19 to circa 70.1bil pieces in 1QFY20 and capacity utilisation rate remained above 90%. This was driven by strong demand as the group’s market share for nitrile gloves from the US, Western Europe and Japan markets grew. The group plans to increase its capacity in CY20F by 16.8% (previously planned expansion of +27.6% YoY). We are positive on the expansion delay as this will alleviate some of the pressure on ASP.
Moving forward, we believe that Top Glove will continue to face pressures on operating profit margins. This is due to the 14.2% increase in nitrile and latex glove supply in CY20F by top rubber glove producers in Malaysia (Top Glove, Kossan, Hartalega) and Thailand (Sri Trang). This exceeds the organic demand growth expectation of 8–10%. This will be further aggravated by higher labour cost in CY20F following the 9.1% upward revision in minimum wage.
According to the Malaysian Rubber Board, latex price has risen by 4.8% to RM4.55/kg in Dec 2019 (average of RM4.34/kg in 1QFY20). The group expects latex price to remain high initially due to low yield during wintering season but will decline in 2HFY20 as yield increases. The group said nitrile rubber price is on a downtrend as it fell by 7.5% to circa US$0.98/kg in Dec 2019 (average of US$1.06/kg in 1QFY20). We believe the group will face further margin pressures in 1HFY20 before improving in 2HFY20.
The group is adding more automation and digitalisation initiatives in its newer factories, which will improve internal and production efficiency. Also, it would reduce dependence on human labour (currently 2.55 workers is needed per mil pieces of glove). We believe improved production efficiency, higher automation and reduced natural gas price (- 2.96%) from January 2020 onwards will help mitigate margin pressures from weaker selling prices.

topglove,"Wed, 18 Dec 2019, 8:54 AM",TOP GLOVE CORPORATION BERHAD - Within Expectations - PublicInvest Research | I3investor,https://klse.i3investor.com/blogs/PublicInvest/2019-12-18-story248964-TOP_GLOVE_CORPORATION_BERHAD_Within_Expectations.jsp,"Top Glove’s net profit was up marginally by 1.2% YoY to RM111.4m in 1QFY20. The results were in line with both our and street’s forecast at 24% and 26% respectively. Lower ASP has offset the marginally stronger sales volume, resulting in weaker topline YoY. Top Glove’s bottomline, however, was boosted by lower tax expense, as the Group benefitted from reinvestment allowance. We are keeping our earnings forecast and retaining our Underperform call, with an unchanged TP of RM4.15.
Weaker topline cushioned by margin expansion. Top Glove’s 1QFY20 revenue declined by 4.2% YoY to RM1.21bn, on the back of lower ASP for both nitrile gloves (-8% YoY) and latex gloves (-3% YoY). The decline in ASP has entirely offset the slight positive impact of higher sales volume (+0.2% YoY). Strong volume growth for nitrile gloves (+20% YoY) was cancelled out by weaker sales quantity of latex gloves (-24% YoY) and vinyl gloves (-30% YoY). Despite weaker topline, Top Glove’s net profit grew 1.2% YoY as a results of lower tax expense (- 54.7 YoY), as some of the new entities under Top Glove enjoys reinvestment allowance, effectively leading to lower tax rate. Note that the effective tax rate for 1QFY20 has fallen to 10.8%, as opposed to 21% in 1QFY19. PAT margin has expanded to 9.2%, from 8.7% in 1QFY19, as a result.
Segmental information. As the strong competition and oversupply situation in the vinyl gloves segment persists, Top Glove’s China operations continued to record losses of RM1.6m in 1QFY20. On a separate note, Top Glove’s unwavering effort in improving Aspion’s production efficiency and its attempt to renegotiate for higher selling price has led to continuous improvement in Aspion over time, reporting a net profit of RM6m in 1QFY20.
Expansion outlook. With 683 production lines, Top Glove’s current installed capacity stands at 70.1bn pcs pa, as the Group commissioned F32 2nd Phase (+1.2bn pcs pa) in 4QCY19, as well improving the speed of its existing production lines. By 4QCY20, the Group’s total installed production capacity is expected to reach 81.9bn pcs pa. On a side note, construction for Top Glove’s vinyl plant in Vietnam, F41, is currently underway and is expected to start commissioning by 2QCY20. With F41, Top Glove will be able to lower its cost of producing vinyl gloves, given that the labour cost and energy cost is relatively lower in Vietnam, as compared to China.
Labour issues not a concern. In view of the recent labour shortage issue, Top Glove has shared that the Group will recruit foreign labour from Nepal, Indonesia and Myanmar going forward to curb the shortage. On top of that, Top Glove has been allocated with 2.5k foreign workers by the authorities; hence the Group is not facing any labour issues for the time being. However, Top Glove also remains committed to reduce its reliance on human workers by continuously investing into automation. Currently Top Glove’s headcount stands at 2.55 workers per million pcs of gloves.

Amidst the mixed broader market, gains were evident amongst the lower liners as the FBM Fledgling rose 0.1%, while the FBM ACE soared 2.1%.
Market breadth stayed negative as decliners pipped advancers on a ratio of 416-to-407 stocks. Traded volumes, however, rose 2.4% to 2.35 bln shares trading interest were centered towards the lower liners.
Public Bank (+16.0 sen) anchored the FBM KLCI winners list, followed by Tenaga (+16.0 sen), Maxis (+13.0 sen), and Hartalega (+12.0 sen). Top Glove (+21.0 sen) extended its’ gains after delivering a strong set of quarterly earnings. Significant advancers on the broader market were BAT (+78.0 sen), United Plantations (+28.0 sen), Bintulu Port (+18.0 sen), QL Resources (+18.0 sen) and Genting Plantations (+16.0sen).
Key losers on the broader market losers include Panasonic (-RM2.82), Dutch Lady (-RM1.28), New Hoong Fatt (-13.0 sen) and Thong Guan (-13.0 sen). Scientex shed 27.0 sen after 1QFY20 earnings missed analysts’ estimates. On the local bourse, Petronas-related companies like Petronas Gas (-40.0 sen) and Petronas Dagangan (-40.0 sen), fell, while Nestle, MISC and PPB Group declined 30.0 sen, 21.0 sen and 12.0 sen respectively.
Asia benchmark indices finished mostly higher, taking cue from the gains on Wall Street overnight. The Nikkei rose 0.5% to re-claim the 24,000 psychological level. The Shanghai Composite (+1.3%) trended higher for the third straight session, while the Hang Seng Index jumped 1.2% higher. ASEAN equities, meanwhile, closed mostly higher on Tuesday.
U.S. stockmarkets trended higher to close at another fresh record high level on the back of the extended trade relief rally as the Dow gained 0.1%. Likewise, the broader market saw the S&P 500 inch higher anchored by gains in the consumer discretionary sector (+0.6%), while the Nasdaq climbed 0.1% as well.
Major European indices turned lower as the CAC and DAX fell 0.4% and 0.9% respectively on worries that Brexit may take place without a trade agreement in place. The FTSE, however, managed to recover all its’ intraday losses to close 0.1% higher, supported by the weaker British Pound against the Greenback.

THE DAY AHEAD
It appears that there were bouts of bargain hunting activities emerged on the FBM KLCI as investors felt re-assured on the “Phase One” of U.S.-China trade deal that will be signed in January 2020. The extended trade relief rebound alongside with the positive sentiment across global equities may provide some alleviation for the FBM KLCI to build on to its’ gains, playing catch-up with strong momentum across its’ regional peers.
We think that the key index may continue to see some nibbling, but the key index may continue to consolidate, ranging between the 1,558-1,579 levels over the foreseeable future. A breakout above the 1,579 level may prompt the key index higher towards the next resistance located at the 1,590 level. In the meantime, the 1,550 level will serve as the key support.
Expectedly, the FBM Small Cap took a pullback as investor locked in their recent gains. We think the retracement is healthy, premised to the overbought condition. Nevertheless, rotational play may continue to keep trading interest afloat, particularly in the construction, technology, plantation and energy shares.

[TOP GLOVE CORP BHD: This will boost the Group’s total number of production lines by an additional 178 lines and production capacity by 21.3 billion gloves per annum, represent an increase of 30.4% in capacity over the next 2 years; by December 2021, Top Glove is projected to have 861 production lines and a production capacity of 91.4 billion gloves per annum]
The Group’s Sales Revenue for 1QFY20 came in at RM1.21 billion, easing by 4.2% compared with 1QFY19, due to lower average selling prices (ASPs) and lower average raw material prices, but Sales Volume increased by 0.2% and Profit After Tax increased by 0.1% year on year to RM111.8 million.
The nitrile glove segment continued to perform very well, delivering strong Sales Volume growth of 20% and significantly higher contributions to Group Profit. Ongoing technological advancements, as well as automation and digitalisation initiatives which resulted in more efficiency and better quality control, also accounted for the improved profit. Thus, the Group was able to increase both sales and profitability. Meanwhile, increased nitrile capacity from ongoing organic expansion allowed the Group to further grow sales, cater to larger customers and capture a bigger market share in US, Western Europe and Japan.
The Group is confident that demand growth for natural rubber gloves in developing countries will pick up going forward, driven by increased healthcare awareness arising from improved standards of living. Average latex concentrate prices at RM4.13/kg, up 8.7% against 1QFY19, while the average nitrile latex price was USD1.06/kg, down 14.5% year on year.
QoQ:
The Group’s Sales Revenue for 1QFY20 was RM1.21 billion, up 1.7% quarter on quarter, with strong growth in Sales Volume (Quantity Sold) of 6% versus 4QFY19. Its profit figures were solid, with Profit Before Tax and Profit After Tax surging 69.6% to RM125.5 million and 51.1% to RM111.8 million respectively.
The Group’s commendable profit was mainly attributed to strong growth in the nitrile glove segment, which saw an increase of 12% in Sales Volume versus 4QFY19. Also contributing to profit margins was the natural rubber glove segment, as the effect of the upward revision in ASPs took effect alongside the downward trend in the price of latex concentrate.
In addition, Top Glove’s Thailand operations contributed positively to its good performance, while the Group continued to see recovery in its China operations, which has improved due to better ASPs for its vinyl gloves. Aspion’s positive profit position also contributed to the Group’s bottom line.
In line with expectations, average latex concentrate prices continued their downward trend, falling by 11% from RM4.64/kg in 4QFY19 to RM4.13/kg in 1QFY20. Average prices for nitrile latex also decreased marginally by 1.8% from USD1.08/kg to USD1.06/kg quarter on quarter.
Prospects:
The Group will continue pursuing expansion in order to meet the increase in global glove demand which is set to grow by 10% yearly. This will boost the Group’s total number of production lines by an additional 178 lines and production capacity by 21.3 billion gloves per annum, represent an increase of 30.4% in capacity over the next 2 years. By December 2021, Top Glove is projected to have 861 production lines and a production capacity of 91.4 billion gloves per annum.
Top Glove will continue to invest in existing line refurbishment and building new technologically advanced glove factories. The Group’s newer factories will feature more automation and digitalisation initiatives, such as an Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV) transport and warehouse management system, production SCADA system, glove auto packing system, artificial intelligence vision camera system for online detection and removal of defective gloves, as well as auto compounding and chemical preparation. In addition, the Group will continue to explore M&As and JVs, while also diversifying into rubber or healthcare-related businesses.
Reflecting the importance of R&D and innovation at Top Glove, plans are in progress to establish a Manufacturing and Research Centre of Excellence, the Group’s new state-of-the-art hub for R&D and product innovation embracing Industry Revolution 4.0 initiatives, based in Banting, Malaysia.
In recognition of its continued good performance, Top Glove remains a component of the FBM KLCI following a recent review by the FTSE Russell in December 2019. Top Glove also garnered several prestigious local and regional HR awards in October and November 2019, which include Graduates’ Choice Award 2019: Champion (Manufacturing), Malaysia’s 100 Leading Graduate Employers 2019: Winner (Chemicals and Heavy Industries) and HR Asia’s Best Companies to Work for In Asia 2019 (Malaysian Chapter): Winner.
As a socially responsible employer and industry leader, Top Glove is committed to upholding fair labour practices and complying with requirements of labour laws, while ensuring adequate measures are in place to protect the safety and well-being of its workforce. In the face of a difficult business environment, Top Glove remains upbeat in terms of outlook. Industry prospects remain promising and to ensure it is well-positioned to tap the growing glove demand, Top Glove will continue to prioritise R&D, innovation and Industry 4.0 initiatives. These will enable the company to increase quality, operational efficiency and effectiveness, while keeping customers satisfied and ultimately deliver good results in the quarters to come.

Despite that, rotational play amongst the lower liners kept the FBM Small Cap higher, rising 0.6%, while the broader market finished mixed.
Market breadth turned negative as decliners outmuscled advancers on a ratio of 453-to-376 stocks. Traded volumes fell 22.0% to 2.29 bln shares as buying momentum subsides.
Key decliners on the FBM KLCI were Nestle (-30.0 sen), KLK (-20.0 sen), Petronas Dagangan (-14.0 sen), Tenaga (-12.0 sen) and Hartalega (-8.0 sen). Amongst the biggest decliners on the broader market losers were consumer products stocks like Fraser & Neave (- 76.0 sen), Dutch Lady (-52.0 sen) and Atland Holdings (-17.0 sen), while Bintulu Port and BLD plantations shed 28.0 sen and 14.0 sen respectively.
On the flipside, Panasonic (+RM2.82), QL Resources (+23.0 sen), Ajinomoto (+20.0 sen) and Allianz (+18.0 sen) trended higher on the broader market. Gamuda gained 5.0 sen after delivering stronger quarterly earnings. Key winners on the FBM KLCI were Petronas Gas (+46.0 sen), MISC (+23.0 sen), PPB Group (+8.0 sen), RHB Bank (+8.0 sen) and Top Glove (+6.0 sen).
Asia benchmark ended on a mixed noted as the Nikkei fell 0.3% amid uncertainty over the next phase of U.S.-China trade deal. The Shanghai Composite (+0.6%) extended its gains after the industrial production data rose 6.2% Y.o.Y in November 2019 – five months high, but the Hang Seng Index (-0.4%) snapped a three-day winning streak as political unrest over the weekend took center stage. ASEAN equities, meanwhile, closed mixed on Monday.
U.S. stockmarkets finished at fresh record high levels on reports that the partial U.S.-China trade deal will be signed in January 2020. The Dow rose 0.4%. On the broader market, the S&P 500 added 0.7% with ten of the eleven major sectors in the green, while the Nasdaq finished 0.9% higher.
Earlier, European benchmark indices – the FTSE (+2.3%), CAC (+1.2%) and DAX (+0.9), all extended their gains, building onto gains from the dovish European Central Bank’s stance on future interest rate direction. This came as investors brushed off the Eurozone’s IHS Markit manufacturing purchasing managers index fell that to a 2-month low in December 2019 at 50.6.

 THE DAY AHEAD
The cloudy details surrounding the “Phase One” of U.S.-China trade deal capped the gains on the FBM KLCI yesterday as quick profit taking activities emerged. As it is, we think that the FBM KLCI may march higher as investors continue to bargain hunt pn beaten down stocks. Gains however, will be mild as foreign funds continue to offload Malaysian equities which already marked six consecutive weeks of foreign fund outflow.
We think that the key index will consolidate, ranging between the 1,558- 1,579 levels over the foreseeable future. In the meantime, the 1,550 level will remain as the key support. Should the 1,579 level cleared, mild window dressing activities may spur the key index towards the next resistance located at the 1,590 level.
In the meantime, we also think the lower liners and broader market shares may continue to see sustainable trading interest. However, we do caution that the recent rally amongst the lower liners has turned slightly toppish and could be due for a pullback.

COMPANY UPDATE
Comfort Gloves Bhd‘s 3QFY20 net profit rose 4.9% Y.o.Y to RM7.4 mln, from RM7.1 mln a year ago, in-line with higher sales revenue, which grew 5.9% Y.o.Y to RM134.5 mln, from RM127.0 mln last year. Subsequently, cumulative 9MFY20 also jumped 23.9% Y.o.Y to RM22.9 mln compared to RM18.5 mln earlier, while revenue increased 8.4% Y.o.Y to RM372.1 mln, from RM343.3 mln in 9MFY19. Comment
The latest earnings were broadly in-line with our estimated net profit, although revenue outperformed our expectations and accounted for 81.2% of our previous estimated revenue of RM458.4 mln, mainly due to higher-than-expected ASPs.
Moving forward, we revised our FY20- FY21 revenue upwards by 10.5% and 12.1% to RM506.4 mln and RM538.1 mln respectively, on the back of stronger ASPs, while net profit estimates remains unchanged after some minor housekeeping in our margins, depreciation and net interest assumptions.
Subsequently, we maintain our BUY recommendation on CGB with an unchanged target price of RM0.95 by ascribing to a target PER of 17.0x to CGB’s FY20 EPS of 5.6 sen, as we continue to believe in its solid revenue growth and earnings recovery prospects, after overcoming the FDA issue last year.
The ascribed target PER remains at a discount to the PER of industry bellwethers like Hartalega Holdings Bhd and Top Glove Corporation Bhd due to CGB’s smaller market capitalisation and capacity. Potential downside risks to our call include labour abuse allegations, unexpected fluctuations in latex prices and forex movements. COMPANY BRIEF

topglove,"Wed, 11 Dec 2019, 9:20 AM",Glove Sector - Pressure on ASP to continue - AmInvest Research Reports | I3investor,https://klse.i3investor.com/blogs/AmInvestResearch/2019-12-11-story246171-Glove_Sector_Pressure_on_ASP_to_continue.jsp,"Investment Highlights
We are keeping our NEUTRAL call for the glove sector. We believe that selling prices and operating profit margins of the glove companies will come under pressure due to a short-term oversupply in the industry.
Nevertheless, in terms of demand, we expect sales volume to continue to grow circa 8–10% in 2020. The expected robust growth is underpinned by an expanding global healthcare sector as well as increased awareness on the importance of hygienic practices throughout the industry, especially in emerging markets such as India and China.
Currently, glove consumption per capita in emerging markets such as India and China is still low at around 2–6 gloves as opposed to circa 100–280 gloves for developed countries. Malaysia’s exports of rubber gloves in 2018 grew 14.0% YoY (+7.6% natural rubber gloves; +18.2% nitrile gloves) while according to the Malaysian Rubber Glove Manufacturers Association (Margma), the rubber glove industry has been growing at an average of 8–10% for the past 25 years.
We believe the pressure on selling price will continue in 2020 as the “Big 3” producers (Top Glove Corporation, Kossan Rubber Industries, Hartalega Holdings) are still in expansion mode. There is also an influx of latex glove supply coming from Thailand’s Sri Trang as the group plans to increase its capacity to 30bil pieces by end-2020 from 22bil pieces in 9M19. 2020 will see an enlarged supply of gloves by circa 17.6%, although the expansion is at a gradual pace. As this exceeds the organic demand growth expectation of 8–10%, we believe the average selling price (ASP) will continue to be weighed down.
We anticipate operating margins pressure to remain in 2020 as we believe the “Big 3” producers will continue to be hit by intense competition, higher labour costs, mixed raw material prices and higher gas tariff. We believe labour cost will continue to rise as more scrutiny is placed into the glove manufacturers’ labour practices and we expect a stricter regulation on foreign worker recruitment.
Our house projection for the USD/MYR rate is an average of RM4.12 in 2020. We expect the stronger ringgit will add to the downward pressure on the glove producers’ margins. The “Big 3” producers benefited from the weaker ringgit (-3.7% YoY at RM4.14) in 9M19 as exports made up most of the sales although these were inadequate to make up for the weakness in ASP.
We may upgrade our NEUTRAL call for the sector to OVERWEIGHT should there be: (1) any pandemic disease outbreaks which cause an upsurge in glove demand; and (2) supply constraints for substitute latex and nitrile gloves, resulting in a switch to latex and nitrile gloves. Conversely we may downgrade to UNDERWEIGHT in the event of: (1) a sustained supply glut, triggering a price war that crimps margins; and (2) the inability of glove makers to pass on the rising costs.
Our top pick is Kossan (BUY, FV: RM4.65). We like Kossan for its expansionary plans and efforts in improving operational efficiency.
We take this opportunity to cut our FY20F, FY21F and FY22F earnings forecast by 4.7%, 4.0% and 2.3% respectively for Top Glove (BUY, FV RM5.12) to account for increased competition, higher labour requirement and higher latex prices. Our FV is based on a P/E of 27x on FY21F EPS. Our PE multiple is based on Top Glove’s historical average forward PE.  
We also reduce Hartalega’s (HOLD, FV RM4.87) FY20F, FY21F and FY22F earnings forecast by 2.0%, 1.9% and 1.9% respectively to account for the pressure on ASP as well as tougher operating conditions

HARTALEGA HOLDINGS BERHAD - https://www.mykayaplus.com/ | I3investor,https://klse.i3investor.com/blogs/httpswwwmykayapluscom/2019-12-06-story244527-_KAYAPLUS_TOP_GLOVE_CORPORATION_BERHAD_V_S_HARTALEGA_HOLDINGS_BERHAD.jsp,"The glove-making sector has always been a favourite business segment that Malaysian investors love.
It is one of the few business segments that we enjoy a 63% GLOBAL market share. Malaysia has a handful of glove manufacturers that produced around RM 18 billion worth of gloves. That means more than 1 out of 2 gloves produced worldwide is made in Malaysia.
The glove industry is so big, that even non-investors are familiar with the bigger glove companies in our country. And of course, the famous duo powerhouses when it comes to glove manufacturers are none other than Top Glove Corporation Berhad (Top Glove Bhd) and Hartalega Holdings Berhad (Hartalega Bhd).
Both companies are the kings of glove-making in Malaysia. Top Glove Bhd and Hartalega Bhd both contributed close to 50% of Malaysia's glove export market. But who is the biggest and better between both giants?
Let's take a look at a head-to-head comparison of both Top Glove Bhd and Hartalega Bhd!
Assets & Annual Capacity
In terms of size, Top Glove is humongous! As of 2019, Top Glove Bhd has a total asset value of RM 5.7 billion! Put side by side against Hartalega Bhd's asset size, it does seem a bit surreal that Hartalega Bhd's asset size is only half of Top Glove Bhd at RM 2.9 billion!
Capacity wise, Top Glove Bhd is able to churn out 64 billion pieces of gloves as of their plant set up in 2019. This also overshadows the annual capacity of Hartalega Bhd, which clocked a capacity of 36 billion pieces per annum as of 2019.
In terms of size, the king is Top Glove Bhd!
Revenue & Profitability
With its size and capacity, it is no surprise that Top Glove comes out with blazing guns. As of its latest 2019 annual report, Top Glove registered its historical best revenue of RM 4.8 billion. Hartalega Bhd also registered its best-ever revenue record which stood at RM 2.8 billion. But notice that the big difference we saw when comparing the asset sizes of both companies has reduced quite a bit! Ratio-wise, Top Glove Bhd registered RM 0.89 worth of sales for every RM 1 of assets, while Hartalega Bhd achieves RM 0.96 worth of sales for every RM 1 of its assets
Moving on to the profitability is where we noticed a surprising change! Hartalega Bhd, with lesser sales, recorded an operating profit of RM 561 million for 2019, while Top Glove Bhd managed RM 495 million. Hartalega Bhd had a superior profit margin that enables it to register a higher profit than its counterpart Top Glove Bhd! It's no wonder that Hartalega hence has a Return on Equity of 20% while Top Glove registered a Return on Equity of 14%
Balance Sheet Strength
Although Top Glove Bhd is way superior in asset size, upon checking their latest report we noticed that it is a majority is funded by debt, hence giving it a very high gearing ratio! Hartalega Bhd, on the other hand, has a significantly lower gearing ratio at just 15%.
Rather than pinpointing and making quick conclusions that higher gearing is unfavourable, it is better to understand the growth plans and methods of both companies. Top Glove Bhd usually increases its capacity size and growth by acquisition of smaller glove companies. To have the financial muscle to pull off company acquisitions, Top Glove would have to take on loans and borrowings on top of the cash it generates from its business to further fund its growth. Top Glove Bhd has a current ratio close to 1 as of 2019, hence I would not be that afraid on its cash flow management and liquidity!
Hartalega Bhd grows its business via investments made to its National Glove Complex (NGC). Hartalega Bhd built its state of art glove manufacturing complex in Sepang. The company has the engineering know-how and technical knowledge to build and design their line from scratch, hence giving them better control and understanding when it comes to sizing up its plants and increasing efficiency. This is why even though with lower revenues, Hartalega Bhd is still able to register a way higher profit than Top Glove Bhd!
Dividends, Valuation and Trend
Glove business is surprisingly a cash-generating business. Even though most glove-making companies are very aggressive in their capacity expansions, most of them are still able to pay out consistent dividends to shareholders. Top Glove Bhd announced a dividend per share of RM 0.075 for the year 2019. Hartalega Bhd distributed a dividend per share of RM 0.082 per share.
Even though both Top Glove Bhd and Hartalega Bhd have shown consistency and increasing trends in distributing dividends year-on-year, the dividend yield of both companies is actually very little. At the time of writing, the dividend yield of both companies is in between 1.5-1.7% per annum. This is again further supported by the fact that both companies are trading at high Price to Earnings ratio, with Top Glove Bhd having a PE ratio of 31 and Hartalega Bhd with a PE of 44!
Why are both stocks trading at such a high premium compared to other listed companies? This is because both companies have a proven track record of ever-increasing sales and profits for the past 10-year plus time horizon! Top Glove Bhd has grown its top line at a fantastic rate of 8.73% (10 years CAGR), while Hartalega Bhd's 10 CAGR stood at a mind-boggling 17.33%!
Given its higher margin and higher CAGR growth, it is no wonder that Hartalega Bhd is trading at a higher price to earnings ratio compared to Top Glove Bhd.
Verdict
Both companies are considered the crown jewels of Malaysian equities that have rewarded their shareholders generously with dividends and mind-boggling capital gains. Both companies are actually great paying dividend companies as they have a dividend policy to pay out 45%-50% of their profit to shareholders, while also having a solid track record to perform regardless of macro-economic changes.
It is, however, the high valuation and price that both companies are currently trading at that drive down the dividend yield and potential upside capital gains. This does reaffirm the popular saying that good stocks aren't really that cheap and cheap stocks aren't really that good!
Do you currently hold any shares in either Hartalega Bhd or Top Glove? Do you think the growth has come to an end or that it will go on and on and on?

Top Glove Corporation Berhad (Top Glove Bhd) is a listed glove manufacturing company. It is the world’s largest glove-making company, with manufacturing facilities in Malaysian, Thailand, and China. Top Glove was founded in 1991by Tan Sri Dr. Lim Wee Chai with just 1 factory, 1 line, and just 100 workers. Top Glove Bhd now has an annual capacity of 64 billion pieces as of 2019.
Top Glove Bhd’s growth is mainly fueled by its strategic and shrewd merger and acquisition deals. How Top Glove Bhd grows its capacity is by buying out smaller glove manufacturers and consolidating their capacity to its capacity count and growth. It has proven to be a successful strategy as Top Glove is now the world’s largest glove factory with mind-boggling capacity.
Top Glove Bhd’s main business is in the manufacturing of gloves, namely nitrile gloves and rubber gloves. It started off as a major rubber glove manufacturer. But as nitrile gloves slowly gain popularity, Top Glove has been reducing rubber gloves production and increasing nitrile glove production over the years.

  Financial Performance
Top Glove Bhd has seen fantastic growth over the last 10 years. Net profit also saw growth from RM 250 million to RM 368 million as of the year 2019. Although they started off as a strong rubber glove producer, Top Glove Bhd manage to switch to the more favourable nitrile gloves, which in the year 2016 surpasses their rubber gloves production. Nitrile gloves are stronger than traditional latex gloves, while also offering higher chemical resistance.
As of 2019, Top Glove Bhd has a Return On Equity (ROE) of roughly 15% and a Return Of Assets (ROA) of around 6%. Even though profit has increased quite a lot in the last 10 years, ROE and ROA are on a downtrend as the number of equity increases more than the profits generated. Top Glove’s growth plans hinged strongly on the effective merger and acquisition, Hence compared to its competitor Hartalega Holdings Berhad, Top Glove Bhd has a higher gearing ratio, where the majority of its funds required for expansion is obtained via a mixture of debt and equity financing. Nonetheless, it still clocks a respectable ROE and ROA when compared with other glove companies.

2015 2,687,930 1,073,537 1,614,393 1.60
In the year 2019, Top Glove Bhd has Assets of around RM 5.7 billion, liabilities of RM 3.1 billion and Equities of RM 2.6 billion. The current ratio is close at 0.97, which gives us assurance it has enough current assets to meet its current liabilities.
Free Cash Flow & Dividends Paid Out
Source: TOP GLOVE CORPORATION BHD ANNUAL REPORT
Glove manufacturing is a cash cow business. Top Glove Bhd has proven that with the rapid expansion of its merger and acquisition, and an increase in revenues and profits, operating cash flow also trends up accordingly. Dividends paid has a 10-year compounded average growth rate of around 7.1%
Top Glove Bhd actually is considered a fantastic growth and dividend stock. Given its successful track record in increasing sales, profits, cash flow and historical dividends paid out, there are plenty of shareholders who are reaping great dividend yields for holding on to Top Glove Bhd shares for a long period of time. Plus, Top Glove Bhd also has a dividend policy of distributing a minimum of 50% of its annual profits to shareholders as dividends
But as Top Glove Bhd is trading at a Price to Earnings ratio of roughly 32 times, many investors would automatically disregard it as a good dividend stock, as its current trailing dividend yield is just at 1.63% per annum.
Price
MyKayaPlus Verdict
Top Glove Bhd is one of the rare companies that is a combination of growth and dividend company. And share prices automatically go up when a company keeps getting more sales and profit, with also increasing dividends paid out.
Hence, it is not surprising that Top Glove Bhd is currently trading at a Price to Earnings ratio at about 32 times. Of course, it is a high price to pay even for such a fantastic company. 
But it all boils down on how aggressive Top Glove will continue to grow as it maps out its expansion plans beyond 2020. We have seen Top Glove buying up factories in countries outside of Malaysia. Being a global player, Top Glove will definitely be ready for any opportunities around the world.

Malaysia glove manufacturers supply the majority of glove markets in the world, they constitute above 60% of the world market share. In particular, Top Glove claims to be the world’s largest glove manufacturer in the world, while Hartalega claims to be the world’s largest nitrile glove manufacturer in the world.
  Below is a comparison of the major glove manufacturers in Malaysia, in terms of earnings, dividend return and efficiency of the management. Scores are assigned to each indicator and added up together to obtain an overall performance score for each manufacturer, which gives an indication of the glove counters most worthy to invest in.
  SECTION 1 – CURRENT EARNINGS, SHARE PRICE AND PRICE TO EARNING (P/E) RATIO
  In terms of share price and earning per share, Top Glove, Hartalega and Kossan Rubber are the top three performers. Accordingly, these three counters also have the highest P/E ratio, indicating they are more expensive to invest in. Also, as shown by the five-year earning per share trend, Top Glove, Hartalega and Kossan Rubber shows a decreasing trend of earnings from year 2015 to 2019. This may be caused by decreasing profit margin resulted from strong competition.
   


SECTION 2 – DIVIDEND PER SHARE, DIVIDEND YIELD AND DIVIDEND PAYOUT RATIO
  Dividend payout by listed companies to shareholders is an additional return of investment to shareholders in addition to the increase of share values. Generous dividend payout to shareholders will attract more investors to invest in the counter.
  Top Glove and Hartalega pay the highest dividend per share overall. However, due to the expensive share price, the dividend yield is below 2%, which is lower than fixed deposit rate. Also notable Hartalega is the most generous in dividend payout, whereby it paid out more than 60% of its earnings in the latest financial year.
   
SECTION 3 – PERFORMANCE OF THE MANAGEMENT TEAM


The long term success and profitability of the glove manufacturers will depend of the efficiency and smart strategies of the companies’ management team. Some of the indicators offer some ideas on the strength of the management teams.
  Among the manufacturer counters investigated, it is shown that Hartalega has the highest return on equity, meaning it earns the most profit per unit of capital provided by the shareholders. Also it has the lowest cost-to-income ratio, meaning it is able to control operational cost to the lowest possible level. Increasing implementation of automated production lines decreases labour cost. In addition, Hartalega uses empty oil palm fruit bunches as biomass fuel to generate heat for production processes, which decreases power cost of the manufacturing plants.
  Also, noted Top Glove, Hartalega and Kossan Rubber invest significantly on capital expenditure in order to increase production capacity. This could decrease the per unit production cost of the gloves and in turn increase profitability.
 
SECTION 4 – CASH AND ASSETS VALUES
  Sufficient amounts of assets and cash are important for security of the manufacturers in case any emergency situations happen. According to below graphs, it is shown that most of the manufacturers investigated are well-supported by sufficient amount of assets, such as net tangible assets (NTA), market capital and cash flows. So, overall these counters are safe to invest in.
 
SECTION 5 – MARKET CONFIDENCE ON THE COUNTERS
  Overall, there is great interest invest in the major glove counters, such as Top Glove, Hartalega and Supermax, which is shown by the number of shareholders and daily trading volume. Also noted these counters are well supported by institutional investors such as EPF, foreign and local investments funds and insurance companies.
  SECTION 6 – OVERALL PERFORMANCE AND SCORING OF THE BANKS

Each of the investigated bank counters are assigned a score based on the above indicators. For each indicator, the best performing counter is given score 7, the second best performing counter is given score 6 and so on. The total score for each counter is added up to give an overall performance score of each counter. According to the below graph, overall best performing counters are Top Glove, Hartalega and Kossan Rubber, respectively. In conclusion to the above analysis, these are the three counters most recommended to invest in in the gloves manufacturing sector.

之前猜测西港或取代顶级
市场之前预期西港（WPRTS,5246,主板交通物流组）最有希望成为纳入综指的新晋“黑马”，以及顶级手套（TOPGLOV,7113,主板医疗保健组）可能被除名，如今则显示顶级手套稳住股价表现，避免进一步滑落，从而保住综指成分股的地位。
料采11月25日闭市市值数据
联昌研究预料，富时罗素将采用11月25日（生效日的前4周）闭市的市值数据作为富时大马指数系列的检讨基准。所有成分股变动将在2019年12月23日生效(周一）。
“此检讨受市场紧密关注，因为它将冲击综指关联产品，例如综指30交易所指数基金（FTSE 30 ETF)和综指关联基金。综指成分股占总市值的61%。”
联昌指出，根据11月25日的闭市价，没有任何一只综指成分股跌落至第36或更低的位置，而须被除名。同时，也没有任何非综指股升上第25或更高的位置，而达到入榜资格。
联昌对综指成分股进行流动性测试，全部综指股都过关。因此，该行达致结论：即将公布的综指检讨，不会有任何变动。
联昌表示，富时大马指数的基本条件，包括纳入富时大马指数股项，在检讨期间内的市值扬升至第25位置或高于主板合格股项、至于被除名的股项，在检讨期间内排名落在36位或低于主板合格股项内。
除了市值排名，另外两个达到纳入综指考量因素，则包括自由流通率达15%以上以及流动性条件。
截至2019年10月31日，银行股占综指最大比重，达36.17%，其次为公用股，占13.29%，以及食品和饮料领域占12.38%。
综指今年跌5.9%
主因：市场忧全球成长企业盈利
联昌研究表示，综指今年以来共下跌5.9%，主要是由于市场担心全球成长和企业盈利趋势。
联昌分析的59只股至今已公布的第三季业绩中，16.9%超越预期（第二季为10%），但是有44.1%低于预期（第二季40%），其余符合预期。
该行保持预测综指今年杪目标为1583点，根据15.5倍本益比估值。
“由于国内政策改革，2020年可能减息，以及美中贸易紧张可能再升级，我们预期股市将保持窄幅波动。’联昌首选股项为戴乐集团（DIALOG,7277,主板能源组），马太平洋（MPI,3867,主板科技组）和国家能源（TENAGA,5347,主板公用事业组）。

Some key takeaways include discussions on China’s rising representation on the MSCI indices and the environmental, social and governance (ESG) criterion becoming increasingly important, among others. MQ Research’s top picks include CIMB, Tenaga, Top Glove and others.
Event
Macquarie and Bursa Malaysia hosted a seminar led by representatives from MSCI, exploring the impact of changing representation of major indices on investing trends and opportunities. For Malaysia, the message was clear, i.e. while rising representation of China on the indices was going to reduce Malaysia’s importance in these indices (MQ est. -0.1ppt to 1.86% in MSCI Emerging Market Index), there was ample room for Malaysia to mitigate if not reverse these trends.
Impact
Greater representation of key economic sectors required. While Malaysia’s market cap to gross domestic product (GDP) at 4.4x is not low vs regional peers, the representation of sectors on the market are not reflective of the economy. Panellists at the seminar pointed to consumer and tech sectors as being examples of under-representation in the stock market. While 61% of GDP by demand aggregates comes from Private Consumption and 21% of GDP by economic activity, representation amongst the top-100 stocks on the Bursa is <6%, if plantations are excluded. Separately, IT is only 1% of the top-100 despite making up 38% of exports and an important part of the digital economy. In the tech space, one option would be for the government, via Khazanah and Permodalan Nasional Berhad (PNB), to spin off digital assets to spearhead the “establishment” of a sector by which other start-ups can at least derive a following and the necessary valuations. Tax breaks and other incentives to encourage multi-national companies in Malaysia with sizeable operations here to list, would be another option.
ESG – an increasingly important criterion. ESG has become an increasingly important criteria for investors globally and even within the region and Malaysia. Big data analytics are being added to public statements by listed companies to rank companies for ESG, and there is a gap between the performances of higher ranking ESG companies vs their lower ranked peers. 28 Malaysian companies feature in MSCI’s Leaders Indices.
Increased free float helps but…. While panellists at the conference acknowledged that increasing the free float of larger companies would help with Malaysia’s weightings within indices, it would be less meaningful. Growth was seen as a far bigger driver of a company’s attractiveness within a regional or global context and thus having more high growth companies listed would have a greater impact on Malaysia’s weightings.
Outlook
MQ Research’s key picks for Malaysia are reflective of the key thematics, ie 1) increased government activity (Gamuda, Ranhill, CIMB, MyNews), 2) policy reforms (Tenaga, M’sia Airports, Telekom Malaysia), and 3) global thematics/weak MYR plays (Sime Plant, IHH, Top Glove, PChem).

  **analysis based on 2019 annual report.
1.       GENERAL INTRO: Top Glove is one of the major glove manufacturers in Malaysia.

d.      Top Gloves' last five years earning per share is steady, ranging from 12 to 17sen. At current share price, P/E ratio is at relatively high level (31). High PE level may be due to support by investors who are confident of the future prospects of Top Glove, which likely to have increased earnings once factories expansion has been completed.
  3.       IS THIS COUNTER A STRONG GROWTH STOCK? 
a.       REVENUE RANGE (million): ~4801 million in 2019 annual report, this is a high revenue company.
b.      SHARE PRICE: from 2015-2019, share price dropped significantly in 2016 and 2018 due to stock splitting. Most of the time share price steady at around RM5
c.       EARNING PER SHARE (EPS): earning per share in last 5 years were steady, range from 12 to 17 sen per share.

We are upgrading our call on Top Glove (TOPG) to BUY from SELL, after raising our TP to RM5.20 from RM4.10, as we are expecting better quarters ahead for the sector and TOPG, due to improving demand for Malaysian rubber gloves. We believe that since the US has already started to impose a 15% tariff on gloves from China, buying patterns should start to normalise, as distributors were stocking up on China gloves in anticipation of the tariff hike. Medical gloves imported from China into the US has risen by 45% YTD (Sep) with a 14% market share.
Malaysia is still the market leader, but China has gained ground
Despite the significant gain in market share (sales volume) by the Chinese manufacturers for glove sales to the US (which has risen from 10.2% in 2018 to 14.2% in Sep 19), Malaysia still remains the market leader with a 74.2% share. The gain in market share has nevertheless impacted the overall demand from Malaysian manufacturers like Top Glove, as overall glove imports from the US only grew by 1% yoy for the first 9 months in 2019. Malaysian manufacturers were not the only casualties, as Thailand and Indonesia also recorded 4% and 19% decline in their sales to the US. We believe that Malaysian manufacturers will start gaining market share in the coming months as the 15% tariff on Chinese gloves was implemented since Sep19.
Improvement to start from the 4QCY19
We believe that sentiments on the sector would improve as the recovery in demand starts to be reflected in the manufacturers books starting with their 4Q19 results. Although there are concerns over rising competition from Thailand, given that Sri Trang Gloves (SRI) is aggressively building capacity as they prepare for an IPO in 3Q20, we believe that SRI is unlikely to cut prices further to compete for market share gains as their new capacity will only be ready by 2H20. Rubber glove manufacturers with significant exposure in the latex glove segment such as Top Glove, were impacted by the price pressure.
Upgrade to BUY with higher TP of RM5.20
As we are taking a more positive stance towards the sector and Top Glove’s outlook, we are raising our TP to RM5.20 from RM4.10 based on a higher 31x CY20E PER (+1 SD) from the previous 24x. We believe that at a PER of +1SD, valuations are still palatable due to its decent earnings growth. Key downside risk to our investment thesis are: (i) sharp increase in volatility of RM/US$, (ii) unexpected increase in operating cost, (iii) irrational competition among its peers, and (iv) the removal of TOPG from the FBMKLCI index.

大众研究表示，美国总统特朗普在2019年8月宣布对价值3000亿美元的中国进口商品加征10%的关税，并分两批次落实（4A和4B清单），特朗普过后又将10%税提高到15%。
而橡胶制成的医用手套（在4A清单中）和乙烯基手套（在4B清单中）属于受影响的商品。
4A清单的新关税已于9月1日生效，从6月开始大马手套生产商的丁腈手套需求便告增加，以供9月及之后出货。
该行指出，胶手套销量回升的部份原因，是一些中国制造商将订单转移至大马，以避开额外的关税。全球丁腈手套的供应量约有10%来自中国。
贺特佳销售大增
手套销售大增的趋势对贺特佳（HARTA,5168,主板医疗保健组）更为明显，该公司在2020财年第二季销售量按季增长12.7%。平均产能使用率也从第一季的76%上升至第二季的85%，表示了其手套的需求更为强劲。
至于下一轮的新增关税即将开始。4B清单的新关税将从12月15日起生效。
但是，该行认为大马手套生产商不会从下一轮关税上调中显著受益，因为这只影响乙烯基手套进口，而乙烯基手套和乳胶手套之间的价格差异巨大。
乙烯基手套的市价目前徘徊在每千只10美元左右，而乳胶手套的售价大约为每千只17美元。由于乳胶手套的溢价高达70%，乙烯基手套的用户料不会转向乳胶手套，因为即使支付更高关税，乙烯基手套的价格仍然较低。
首选股高产柅品
由于营运环境转佳，供应过剩的忧虑解除、丁腈手套需求回升，该行将将胶手套领域评级上调至中和，首选股为高产柅品（KOSSAN,7153,主板医疗保健组），看好该公司产能即将大增，其18号厂（年产能25亿只）8条生产线中的6条已启用，剩余两条将在2019年1月投入运作。至于19号厂（年产能30亿只）将于2019财年第一季启用，由于近期需求回升，相信新增产能将快速被市场消化。
若除名成份股
顶级手套恐引卖压
此外，大众表示，顶级手套（TOPGLOV,7113,主板医疗保健组）目前市值排名马股第35位，如果掉落至第36位，则将自动从综指成份股除名，这可能引发更多卖压。

（吉隆坡17日讯）泰国诗董橡胶公司（Sri Trang Agro Industry）酝酿将手套业务挂牌上市，有分析员预言，诗董手套将会在中期之内崛起成为顶级手套（TOPGLOV，7113，主板保健股）的劲敌。
摩根大通分析员指出，诗董橡胶是一个横跨上中下游的综合橡胶生产商。该集团的下游业务为手套生产，并且是泰国最大手套制造商，年产能可达212亿只，全球市占率为8%。
“对比一下，顶级手套则是世界最大的手套制造商，产能高达639亿只，全球市占率为24%。”
诗董集团放眼在2020年第三季，将橡胶手套制造业务挂牌上市。分析员认为，诗董手套会成为顶级手套的中期威胁。
“诗董的竞争优势包括有垂直整合的业务架构，受益于低原材料成本（没有附加税开销，节省约5至6%成本）和内部生产的胶乳，以及泰国政府的给予下游橡胶业者用以扩充业务最高3%的利息津贴。”
橡胶手套竞争加剧
分析员也点出，诗董手套有意在2020年前将产能提高至300亿只，在2025年再提高至500亿只。
“由于诗董将积极扩充产能，加上有中游业务和政府津贴优势，橡胶手套业在中期内的竞争压力将继续提加剧。”
分析员预计，顶级手套的赚幅在未来6至18个月将面临重度的下行压力。不过有好消息是，今年首半年价格飙涨30%的胶乳原材料已恢复正常，因此，这意味着顶级手套下季度的赚幅可能会有改善。
另外，虽然面对来自橡胶手套业务的赚幅压力，但顶级手套在生产组合提升丁腈手套的份量，有助缓和橡胶手套业务的冲击。
“顶级手套目前的丁腈手套业务赚幅，比橡胶手套高2至3%。另外，丁腈手套业务的销售量在2019财年按年劲增30%。我们认为这意味着公司在丁腈手套的市占率将有提升。”
汰弱留强涌现并购商机
顶级手套执行主席丹斯里林伟才接受《南洋商报》电访时指出，业界的竞争一直都存在，因为手套业有非常好的前景。
“我们欢迎良性的竞争，因为这可以让我们更勤快和聪明地工作，进而激励出最佳的自己。”
新兴市场需求劲增
另外，他也指出，竞争将让行业变得更有效率，汰弱留强，这也将为顶级手套带来并购商机。
“橡胶手套的需求增长依然强劲，尤其是来自新兴市场，虽然手套使用率低但在高速增长。我们相信还有扩充的空间，并且会继续稳定地扩展业务，以应对需求增长。”
闭市时，顶级手套以4.34令吉挂收，起5仙或1.17%，成交量有252万股。

  很多投资者常常听到KLCI这个名称，
可能只是笼统的知道它代表着大马股市的晴雨表，
KLCI指数上代表股市好，
KLCI指数跌代表股市不好，
那么KLCI的涨或跌到底是谁来决定的呢？
而代表着KLCI的30大公司又是谁来决定的呢？
如果一家上市公司要进入KLCI指数，
需要符合什么条件呢？
甚至有些投资者更是在利用KLCI来赚钱，
又有人说年尾TOPGLOV就会被提出KLCI版外，
到底他们是如何预测到这个结果呢？
今天我们就来讨论这个话题。
  首先KLCI是由大马交易所上市的，
市值最大的30家公司所组成，
每年有两次REVIEW，
在REVIEW的时候如果上市公司是处于30大市值，
那么就会被归纳为KLCI指数股，
而相反的如果本来在KLCI里面的指数股，
在REVIEW的时候跌出市值30大，
那么就会被刷出去。
而影响市值最大的因素就是股价，
所以可以看到有些公司为了进KLCI指数，
在REVIEW前拼命推高自家的股价，
因为能进入KLCI代表你的公司对大马股市有一定的影响力。
  我们来看一看目前TOPGLOV的市值排名，
由于之前股价大跌的关系，
TOPGLOV已经跌出30大指数股了，
而目前代替它的位置的是WPRTS排名28位，
而目前在TOPGLOV前面的还有很多公司，
30名的AIRPORT， 31名的TM，
32名的F&N，33名的QL，
34名的AMBANK，
所以在12月的REVIEW之前需要打败以上公司，
TOPGLOV才能保留KLCI指数股的位置，
所以喜欢TOPGLOV的朋友要加油啦。
  接下来我们来谈谈到底投资者如何靠KLCI获利。
基本上通过两种方法，
第一种就是买WARRANT，
如果你觉得KLCI会涨就买KLCI的CALL WARRANT，
如果你觉得KLCI会跌就买KLCI的PUT WARRANT，
当然KLCI的WARRANT很多，
当中WARRANT的各自条件都不同，
不同的EXERCISE PRICE MATURITY DATE CONVERTION RATIO，
不只影响了投资者的获利程度，
也影响了该凭单的风险性，
所以不建议初学者买入。
  第二种就是FKLI也就是期货，
这个就比较容易理解，
就好像买大小一样
如果买一张期货，
那么1点就是50块钱。
如果你买一张FKLI涨，
FKLI每涨一点你就赚50块钱，
每跌一点你就赔50块钱，
非常刺激好玩。
外资最喜欢玩的东西，
当外资想要投资大马股市之前，
他们会先买FKLI，
然后再买入指数股推动KLCI，
那么就可以两边赚。
要撤资之前，
会先卖FKLI，
然后再卖股票，
导致指数下跌，
又可以再赚钱。
所以有些人可以从FKLI追踪外资的脚步。
  当然指数股还需要符合一些流动量和持股比率，
比如大股东的持股比率不能超过85%，
和10%的股票需要被交易等等，
但是其实这些条件很多公司都很容易达到，
只是市值不够大而已。
总结来说，
如果你懂得够多，
股市很多投资工具都可以赚钱，
所以要时常留意夜月的FBPAGE学习投资知识，
也要记得SUBSCRIBE夜月的YOUTUBE频道哦。

Budget 2020 promotes responsible growth, addresses the rakyat’s welfare (including fostering home ownership), champions diversity (prosperity to be shared across ethnicities, genders, income groups and regions) and future-proofs the nation with heavy emphasis on the development of a digital and knowledge-based economy.
These budget goals will be achieved without digressing from the commitment towards fiscal consolidation, although Budget 2020 does revise the deficit target slightly higher to 3.2% of GDP (vs. 3% projected during Budget 2019). Nonetheless, this is still an improvement over an estimated deficit of 3.4% in 2019.
The rakyat’s welfare will be safeguarded by cash grant scheme Bantuan Sara Hidup (expanded to cover more individuals), increase in the monthly minimum wage to RM1,200 from RM1,000 in major cities, special payments to civil servants and pensioners of RM500 and RM250 respectively and a new targeted fuel subsidy scheme.
Budget 2020 fosters home ownership by providing guarantee to financing for first-home purchase of up to RM500K through the rent-to-own (RTO) scheme and a monthly instalment assistance of RM200/month during the first two years under a Youth Housing Scheme. It also attempts to help resolve the supply overhang issue in the property sector by lowering the threshold for foreign ownership of condominiums/apartments in urban areas to RM600K from RM1mil.
To hasten the transformation into a digital and knowledge-based economy, Budget 2020 offers grants for the development of the 5G ecosystem, broadband access via satellite technology to remote areas, digital infrastructure in public buildings and digital projects such as drone carriers, self-driving cars and blockchain technology. It also hopes to accelerate the adoption of e-payment by providing a one-off e-wallet incentive of RM30 which could benefit up to 15mil citizens.
Sector-wise, the more apparent winners are consumer (cash grants and fuel subsidies) and property (governmentguaranteed RTO scheme and lower price threshold for foreign ownership) sectors.
On the other hand, we believe the biggest disappointment belongs to the construction sector. While gross development expenditure is projected to increase by 4.3% to RM56bil in 2020 from RM53.7bil estimated for 2019, there is a lack of initiatives to embark on new mega infrastructure projects (typically funded with special purpose vehicle or SPV debts). As development expenditure typically goes towards funding basic infrastructure projects such as roads, bridges, schools and water supply projects, these will largely only benefit smallish/unlisted contractors.
We maintain our end-2019 FBM KLCI target of 1,680pts based on 17x our 2020F earnings projection (+7.9%), which is at a discount to its 5-year historical average of about 18x. We believe the risk-off trade will prevail over the rest of 2019. Investors are likely to continue to lighten their positions in high-risk asset classes, i.e. equities and emerging market (EM) assets, while seeking refuge in safe-haven asset classes, i.e. developed market (DM) bonds and even zero-yielding precious metals.

Typically, an easing cycle in the US shall usher in a new capital inflow cycle to EMs, including Malaysia, as investors step up the hunt for yield. This was the case in June and July 2019 when EM bond funds and Malaysian Government Securities (MGS) both attracted substantial net inflows (Exhibits 1 & 3). We were hopeful then that the inflows would eventually spill over to equities but this did not materialise (Exhibits 2 & 4).
As it stands now, the tailwind of accommodative monetary policy by key central banks in the world has been negated by the headwinds of the heightened US-China trade tensions and a mounting global recession risk, as illustrated in the flattened, and at times, inverted US bond yield curve.
Our Top Buys
Amidst the heightened US-China trade tensions and a mounting global recession risk, we anchor our stock selection on: 1. Value stocks – Malayan Banking (discount to historical P/B ratio, dividend yield of 6–7% p.a.), RHB Bank (0.8–0.9x P/B ratio) and Serba Dinamik (steep discount P/E valuation to peer Dialog Group); 2. Defensive plays in a low interest rate environment – Tenaga Nasional (also potential rerating via a demerger exercise); 3. Beneficiaries of the US-China trade war/trade diversion – Top Glove (tariff advantage over Chinese exporters in the US market) and Westports and MMC Corp (trade diversion from the US-China trade war, as reflected in the increased throughput recently); and 4. Domestic consumption proxies – DRB-Hicom (also Proton’s turnaround), MBM Resources (also Perodua’s dominance in the local auto sector) and Berjaya Food (consumer lifestyle and experience) (Exhibit 5).

We are maintaining our SELL call and TP of RM4.10 on Top Glove (TOPG), post the analyst briefing hosted by the management recently. Although we are expecting strong growth within the nitrile segment to continue, supported by 12% capacity growth, we see downside risk to our latex segment forecasts. As the recovery for latex glove margin is also dependent on latex prices remaining stable throughout FY20, any irrational competition is likely to hamper the recovery.
Irrational Competition From Abroad for the Latex Segment
Sales volume for the latex glove segment only grew by 0.2% yoy for FY19, which is significantly lower than the 23% yoy growth delivered in FY18, as sales volume contracted by 12-23% qoq in 4QFY19. Although the overall capacity for latex glove has been relatively stagnant for the past 5-years, management believes the decline in its market share in recent quarter was due to irrational competition from overseas. We believe management was referring to Sri Trang (STA TB, Not Covered), a rubber plantation company that has aggressively expanded its glove production capacity recently, as it is working towards the listing (IPO) of its rubber glove division soon.
Shifting to Vietnam to Seek Competitive Edge
Despite hitting record profits in FY18 for its vinyl glove segment, profit for the segment was reduced from RM27.9m in FY18 to -RM4.1m in FY19, due to the increase in vinyl glove supply as the government relaxed some environment policy which was supposed to curb overall production capacity in China. Given that Top Glove is not competitive (cost) in China, operating only 1 manufacturing plant, it is now moving forward with its expansion into Vietnam, with production (4.0bn pcs) expected to start in 2Q20. We believe that Top Glove is likely to keep its China plant, to maintain exposure to the fastest growing developing market.
Maintain SELL With An Unchanged TP of RM4.10
We are maintaining our SELL call with an unchanged TP of RM4.10 (24x CY20E PER), as we believe that there could be more downside risk to our earnings forecasts moving forward due to irrational competition in the latex and vinyl segment. Upside risks to our call, would be weakening of MYR against USD, significant drop in latex prices, and China government reintroducing new environment policy to cap capacity.

Management believes that demand for gloves will continue to grow at 10%. Thus, expansion plans remain on track and set to grow by 31.6% to 84.1bn gloves by end-2020. We cut our earnings estimates by 3.9%/3.5%/2.7% for FY20/FY21/FY22 after decreasing our latex and vinyl glove ASP by circa- 3%. TP is lowered to RM4.25/share (previously RM4.41). Maintain sell.
Natural Rubber and Vinyl Gloves Segment Remains Tough
To recap, Top Glove’s FY19 sales of natural rubber gloves grew by only 0.2% (versus 23% in FY18) amid cut-throat competition from Sri Trang, Thailand which reduced product prices to gain market share. This has caused Top Glove’s PBT margin contracted by 3.3p.p to 9% in FY19. To fend off competition going forward, Top Glove would price its natural rubber glove prices to match with the competitor’s average selling prices (currently at USD19/1000 pieces). By doing so, management expects its market share to recover in FY20-21.
In our previous note, we highlighted our concern over the additional supply from Sri Trang, which would likely dent Top Glove’s margins. In our previous forecast, we have assumed some pricing weakness underpinned by addition supply of natural rubber glove from Sri Trang, which target to increase supply to 30bn gloves by 2020 from 17bn pieces in 2018. We now expect the GP margin of natural rubber glove to decline further to circa-15.5% in FY20 (versus 21% and 16% in FY18 and FY19 respectively) amid price competition. A saving grace is that natural rubber latex is also on the downtrend (-7% QoQ). For vinyl gloves, FY19 sale volume contracted by 29% (versus 15% growth in FY18). The contraction, coupled with the rise in production cost, had contributed to EBIT losses of RM4.1mn for FY19 (versus profit of RM27.9mn in FY18). Going forward, the group will expand PVC gloves capacity in Vietnam (4.0bn total gloves capacity, which is set to commence operations in 2Q20) as the cost of production in Vietnam is much lower than in China. However, there are no plans to shut down Top Glove’s manufacturing plant in China as management opines that the decline in profit is cyclical. All in, we do not expect the vinyl glove segment to turnaround in FY20 as vinyl glove ASP is expected to remain low at circaUSD11.5/1000 pieces (versus USD14.5/1000 pieces in FY18).
Expansion Plans and Prospects of Nitrile Gloves
Overall, management remains bullish on the global demand for gloves which is set to grow by 10% in 2020. As such, Top Glove will continue with its expansion plans, ie: to increase capacity by 31.6% to 84.1bn gloves/annum by end-2020 (see table 1). Out of the 20.2bn new gloves capacity, 73% are nitrile gloves while the remaining are vinyl and latex gloves. Note that nitrile gloves accounted for 46% and 42% of Top Glove’s FY19 revenue and volumes respectively (nitrile sales volumes surge by 30% YoY).
Moving forward, we expect most of the additional nitrile expansion to go to the US and Japan markets. Having said that, we do not think that Top Glove would be able to gain additional market share especially in the developed markets (unless they throw price). On a side note, there is some demand coming from developing countries where Top Glove has an entrenched position. Top Glove is expected to gain some market share from struggling competitors like WRP Asia Pacific Sdn Bhd (circa-11bn gloves capacity) and Latex Partners (circa-13bn gloves capacity) in these countries.
In terms of trade diversion from US-China trade war, management expects minimal benefits as China exports only about 3-5% of rubber gloves demand. While we expect Malaysian rubber gloves manufactures to gain market share in the US market (China exports circa-12bn rubber gloves to the US), China manufacturers will likely dump prices in the EU market.

Cut Top Glove's net profit estimates by 10% and 9% for FY20-21.
Trading at rich valuation of above +2.0 SD of 5-year mean.
Maintain HOLD with reduced Target Price of RM4.00.
Optimal Utilisation to Take Time
TOP GLOVE CORPORATION BHD plans to add 18.2bn gloves p.a. of capacity in CY20, raising its annual capacity to 84.1bn. However, the new capacity will be added in phases. Optimal utilisation will likely take time, reducing its effective capacity.
Overall, we are now more conservative and cut Top Glove’s utilisation rate from 85% to 83%. We reduced our target price (TP) from RM4.50 to RM4.00 to reflect the earnings adjustment. (Using the latest FX rate of RM1 to SGD0.3292, we derive the target price of 1.32 in SGD term)
Valuations remain at the high end of its historical range. Maintain HOLD.
Where We Differ
We cut our FY20 and FY21 net profit estimates by 10% and 9% respectively mainly to impute the lower utilisation rate and higher interest expenses (due to higher capex assumptions funded by borrowings). Our assumptions on average selling prices (ASPs) are also more conservative contributing to our earnings forecast being below consensus.
Factoring in Lower Utilisation Rate
Capacity expansion on track...
There are no changes to Top Glove’s plans for capacity expansion since its last update in September 2019. To recap, the Group’s total installed capacity is 63.9bn pieces of gloves. Factory F32 Phase 2 is expected to commence operations in 4QCY19, while F2B’s refurbishment has been scheduled for 1QCY20. Expansion plans for CY20 include F2B refurbishment, Factory F5A, Factory F40, Factory F42 (Phase1), Factory F41 (Vietnam), and Factory F8A (Thailand).
These expansions will add 18.2bn gloves p.a. capacity in CY20, raising Top Glove’s annual capacity to 84.1bn pieces at the end of CY20, up 32% from its current installed capacity of 63.9bn pieces. We have incorporated Top Glove management’s capacity expansion guidance into our earnings forecasts.
…but we are more conservative on utilisation rates.
However, the new capacity will come in phases, with about 62% commercialising only in 2HFY20. As such, the company’s effective capacity will be lower and optimal utilisation will likely take time. Overall, we cut estimates for Top Glove’s utilisation rate from 85% to 83%. Our expected sales volume growth for FY20 is 11%, compared to management guidance of 10-15%.
Raw material prices trending downward.
Raw material prices have been trending downward. According to Bloomberg, nitrile raw material prices dropped to RM6.72/kg (-4.4%) from its high of RM7.04/kg in September 2019. Natural rubber latex prices also fell to RM4.23/kg from its high of RM5.13/kg (-17.5%) in April 2019.
ASP expectations.
ASP for natural rubber latex gloves increased 0.5% to USD19.0/k gloves in September-October 2019 compared to June-August 2019, reflecting pass through of higher raw material prices. ASP for nitrile rubber gloves also increased 1.3% to USD22.7/k gloves in the same period. As such, ASP in 1QFY20 should be higher than 4QFY19.
However, with natural rubber latex raw material prices trending downward since October 2019, we expect ASP to adjust lower in 2-3 months with the cost pass through mechanism.
Minimum impact of US-China trade war.
China’s export of rubber and nitrile gloves to the US is not significant and any order switch from the US is not likely to be material. Overall, the US-China trade war should have minimal impact on Top Glove’s earnings.
No impairment for Aspion.
In 4QFY19, Aspion contributed positively to Top Glove with implementation of transformation processes. Management has guided that there is no impairment required for Aspion in the near term. Aspion will need to register higher sales volume to overcome high fixed costs.
Revised capex forecast to RM600m.
Top Glove’s FY19 capital expenditure (capex) of RM632m (vs RM461m in FY18), was used for new factories (50%), upgrading existing factories (42%) and the balance for maintenance. Management expects to maintain capex at RM600m in upcoming years which will be utilised mainly for new factories in Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam.
We adjusted our capex forecasts upward from RM400m to RM600m for FY20-21 in line with management’s guidance.
Digitalisation and automation to save costs.
In the middle to longer term, Top Glove’s management intends to embark on digitalisation and automation via the Industry 4.0 framework involving the application of Internet of Things (IoT), robotics and automated real-time manufacturing systems. This is to reduce its reliance on foreign labour and improve manufacturing efficiency.
The number of workers/million pieces of gloves has decreased to 2.54 in FY19 (vs 3.43 in FY13) due to Top Glove’s ongoing automation.
Cut net profit forecasts.
We cut our FY20 and FY21 net profit forecasts by 10% and 9% respectively, mainly to impute Top Glove’s lower utilisation rate and higher interest expenses (from higher capex assumption funded by borrowings).
We are taking this opportunity to introduce FY22 net profit estimates of RM500m (+2% y-o-y) on the back of 5% sales volume growth.

We maintain our BUY call on Top Glove Corporation (Top Glove) with an unchanged FV of RM5.47/share based on a P/E of 27.7x on FY21F EPS. Our PE multiple is based on the 1-year industry average forward PE.
We continue to like Top Glove for its: (1) expansionary plans; (2) focus and continual efforts in improving quality and operational efficiencies; and (3) position as the largest rubber glove manufacturer.
The key takeaways from the 4QFY19 analyst briefing are as follows;
1. Increased competition coming from all sides i.e. latex, nitrile and vinyl segments. On a positive note, the group has managed to gain market share in the nitrile space.
2. Aspion’s performance improved in FY19.
3. New technology is expected to improve efficiencies when it is implemented in CY20F and CY21F. 4. Expansion plans remain on track with an additional 18.2bil pieces of gloves in CY20F.
Competition has heightened due to the increased capacity in the rubber glove industry. Top Glove was affected by increased competition from latex, nitrile and vinyl segments in FY19.
Top Glove’s nitrile segment performed encouragingly as sales volume increased 12% QoQ and ASP increased 1% QoQ in 4QFY19. The group was able to gain market share despite the intense competition. As rubber gloves producers ramp up their capacity expansions, we foresee pressure on margins although the group expects an improved performance in the nitrile segment.
Top Glove’s latex segment took a hit in FY19. Sales volume of latex powdered glove dropped 23% QoQ and latex powder free dropped 12% QoQ in 4QFY19 although natural rubber ASP increased 8% QoQ. We anticipate challenges in the latex space to continue as industry production capacity from Thailand increases. However, the lower latex concentrate price (-6.8% since 4QFY19) should slightly offset the pressure on margins.
Vinyl sales volume fell 10% QoQ while ASPs dropped 12% QoQ in 4QFY19. Recall that in 2017, there was a ban on vinyl glove factories in China due to the high levels of air pollution. This had resulted in a supply disruption of vinyl gloves and higher ASP in 2017. However, supply is back as reflected in the weak performance of Top Glove’s China unit. We anticipate the group’s operations in China to continue bleeding due to the stiff competition and higher cost of production.
Top Glove is planning to increase its vinyl gloves capacity by 4.0 bil pieces with a new plant in Vietnam, which is expected to be completed by 2QCY20. The new plant is anticipated to be more cost effective in producing vinyl gloves.
Aspion’s performance improved in FY19 although its utilization rate is still below 60%. The improved performance was attributed to the group’s efforts in modifying the production lines and processes and improvements in customer relationships. Top Glove is expecting a higher contribution in FY20F underpinned by improvements in production efficiencies and quality and higher selling prices.
The group is continuously investing in automation and has reduced number of workers per million pieces of gloves from 3.54 in FY13 to 1.84 in its latest factory (2.51 in FY19). Top Glove has implemented new technologies in its existing and new lines which is expected to improve operational efficiencies. The group plans to use its artificial intelligence (AI) vision camera for online detection and removal of defective gloves. This would save 10% of manpower costs and would be fully implemented in CY20F. However, we believe cost savings will be offset by the downward pressure on margins by heightened competition in CY20F.
Top Glove plans to increase its current capacity to 65.9bil pieces from 63.9bil pieces by end of 2019. In CY20F, the group plans to add 18.2bil pieces (14.2bil of nitrile) in production capacity to a total of 84.1bil pieces of gloves by end-CY20.
Top Glove will continue to face margin pressures due to the influx of nitrile and latex glove supply in CY19E and CY20F. Supply of gloves is expected to increase by 15.0% in FY19E and 22.3% in CY20F on the back of capacity expansions by the top rubber producers in Malaysia and Thailand. In Thailand, Sri Trang plans to increase latex glove supply to 30bil pieces (from 21bil currently) by 2020F.

We expect the group’s overall profitability to continue facing competitive pressure from low margins latex gloves and slow recovery at Aspion although cushioned by uptick in nitrile demand. TP is RM4.00 based on 25.5x CY20E EPS. Reiterate UP.
2nd consecutive quarterly earnings disappointment explained.TOPGLOV’s 4QFY19 post-results’ briefing shed some light on the 5% QoQ sales volume decline and flat PBT growth (-1.2%) despite a net profit growth (+7% due to a low effective tax rate of 1.3% vs normalised going forward mid-teens 15%-17%). The lower QoQ sales volume (- 5%) was largely due to lower latex powder-free (-12%) and latex powderered (-23%) buffered by higher nitrile (+12%). Demand for nitrile continued to remain solid with nitrile and latex product mix ratio of 46% : 54%.
Note that PBT margin was flat QoQ in 4QFY19 at 6.8% despite higher ASP due to lower profit contribution from natural rubber glove segment due to lower sales volume in latex gloves and a small loss in the vinyl glove segment. This brings 4QFY19 PATAMI to RM80.1m (+7.2%) boosted by a lower effective tax rate of 1.2% compared to 8.6% in 3QFY19. All in, TOPGLOV was impacted by lower volumes sales in latex and further dragged down by competitive pressure leading to lower margins which we expect to last over the next subsequent quarters.
Slow recovery in Aspion. Despite chalking up a PATAMI of RM19.6m at Aspion (largely due a positive tax of RM16.6m attributable to deferred tax), PBT only came in at a miniscule RM3m on the back of <60% utilisation rate. The group has implemented a rationalisation process at Aspion including reduction of manpower from 3k workers to 2k and renegotiate better average selling prices terms with customers. All in, we still see low risk of Aspion’s related impairments.
Leveraging on technology to reduce cost and maintain margin. In an effort to further mitigate rising cost and reliance on manual labour and hence maintain margins, the group is embarking on automation (expected to commence 2HCY20) in three key areas including: (i) an artificial intelligence system to detect and removed defective gloves, (ii) automated warehouse management system, and (iii) automated glove packing system. The group expect to see automation initiatives to bear fruits in FY21.
Intense competition in latex more than offset uptick in nitrile demand. Looking ahead, the keen competition in the latex segment could negatively impact latex gloves margin. Although earnings are expected to be underpinned by uptick in nitrile demand, the group is plagued with competitive pressure from low margins latex gloves (accounts for estimated 50% of product mix) which could offset the gains in the nitrile segment. The robust demand for nitrile gloves has led to longer delivery lead times of between 45 to 50 days as compared to 30 to 40 days previously.
Maintain UP. Our TP is RM4.00 based on unchanged 25.5x CY20E EPS (at +1.0SD above 5-year historical forward mean). Although we expect uptick in nitrile demand to anchor growth in subsequent quarters, the group’s overall profitability is facing competitive pressure from low margins latex gloves and a slow recovery at Aspion.
A key upside risk to our call is the better-than-expected margin.

The 4QFY19 earnings was partially subdued due to the lower contribution from the natural rubber and vinyl gloves
Slower sales growth in developing countries as compared to the previous year
The group has strategically align product mix with market demand by focusing on expanding nitrile gloves
Nonetheless, we believe this will result in downward pressure on nitrile glove price
Maintain NEUTRAL with a revised TP of
Significant dropped in sales volume of natural rubber glove. To recall, 4QFY19 earnings rose by +7.2%qoq to RM80.1m. The sequential improvement in earnings was driven by the higher sales volume (+12.0%qoq) and average selling price (+1.0%qoq) of nitrile glove. However, these were mitigated by: (i) significant dropped in sales volume of natural rubber glove (-17.9%qoq); (ii) higher natural rubber latex price (+5.0%qoq); and (iii) declining sales volume of vinyl glove (- 10.0%qoq).
Strategically aligning product mix with market demand. The strong FY19 performance of nitrile glove was attributable to the stronger sales growth in developed countries where sales volume rose by +17.0%yoy. In contrast, the subdued performance of natural rubber glove was driven by the slower sales growth in developing countries where sales volume marginally increased by +3.9%yoy. Consequently, nitrile glove has overtook natural rubber glove as the largest contributor to revenue with contribution of about 46.0% (vs FY18:40.0%) as compared to 39.0% (FY18:45.0%) for natural rubber glove. To capture the growing demand of nitrile glove, Top Glove is expected to add more than 14.2b pieces of nitrile glove production capacity per annum by the end of CY20.
New factories will improve operating efficiency. We view that the aggressive expansion in production capacity of nitrile glove will lead to pricing pressure and hence, lower profit margin. Nonetheless, we take comfort that the new factories will contribute to better productivity. Note that as of FY19, the productivity level of Top Glove’s factories was at about 2.54 workers per million pieces of gloves. These highly automated factories are expected to improve productivity level further as they are able to operate at an average of 1.84 workers per million pieces of gloves.
Impact to earnings. We revised our FY20F/FY21/FY22 downwards by -7.7%/-4.1%/-1.8% respectively as we believe: (i) there will be no meaningful recovery in sales volume for natural rubber and vinyl; and (ii) pricing pressure on nitrile glove will remain in the near term.
Target price. We tweaked our TP downward to RM4.23 (previously RM4.58) per share. Our valuation is premised on FY20 EPS of 16.9sen pegged to an unchanged PER of 25x which is the company’s three-year historical average PER.
Maintain NEUTRAL. We view that the group’s outlook will continue to be underpinned by stable and steady growth in demand of nitrile glove as health regulations become more stringent particularly in the developed markets. In response to this, Top Glove will add more than 14.2b pieces of nitrile glove production capacity per annum by the end of CY20 with total production capacity of about 40.0b pieces per annum (out of its total capacity per annum of 84.1b). By the end of this expansion plan, it will become the world’s largest nitrile glove manufacturer which serves as a competitive advantage over other major glove manufacturers. That said, we opine that the aggressive expansion in production capacity will lead to pricing pressure. In addition, the stock is currently trading at above its three-year historical average PER of 25.0x hence we believe the positivity has been priced in at current valuation. All factors considered, we maintain our NEUTRAL recommendation on the stock.

US: Trade deficit widens more than expected to USD54.9bn in August. With the value of imports rising by more than the value of exports, the Commerce Department released a report showing the US trade deficit widened by more than anticipated in the month of August. The report said the trade deficit widened to USD54.9bn in August from USD54.0bn in July, while economists had expected the trade deficit to widen to USD54.5bn. The wider trade deficit came as the value of imports climbed by 0.5% to USD262.8bn in August after edging down to USD261.4bn in July. Significant increases in imports of cell phones and other household goods, semiconductors, and other industrial machines were partly offset by a steep drop in imports of industrial supplies and materials. Meanwhile, the report said the value of exports rose by 0.2% to USD207.9bn in August after climbing to USD207.4bn in July. (RTT)
US: Unemployment rate falls to 3.5%; job growth steady. US job growth increased moderately in Sept, with the unemployment rate dropping to near a 50-year low of 3.5%, assuaging financial market concerns that the slowing economy was on the brink of a recession amid lingering trade tensions. The employment report, however, showed wage growth stagnating and manufacturing payrolls declining for the first time in six months. The retail sector also continued to shed jobs. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 136,000 jobs last month, the government said. August data was revised to show 168,000 jobs created, instead of the previously-reported 130,000 positions. The initial August job count was probably held back by a seasonal quirk related to students leaving their summer jobs and returning to school. (Reuters)
EU: Retail sales recover in August. Eurozone retail sales recovered in August largely driven by non-food product sales, data from Eurostat showed. Retail sales grew 0.3% MoM in August, reversing a 0.5% drop in July. The rate of growth matched economists' expectations. Food sales remained flat, while non-food product sales gained 0.4%. Automotive fuel in specialized stores edged up 0.1%. YoY, retail sales growth eased marginally to 2.1% from 2.2% in July. Nonetheless, this was slightly faster than the expected 2%. Another report from Eurostat showed that producer prices declined in August mainly due to a notable fall in energy prices. Producer prices decreased by 0.8% annually, following a 0.1% rise in July. Economists had forecast a 0.5% fall. The annual decline reflected a 4.9% drop in energy prices and a 0.4% decrease in intermediate goods prices. (RTT)
EU: Germany construction activity improves in September. Germany's construction sector expanded modestly in Sept, led by a growth in housing activity that offset slower declines in commercial and civil engineering, survey data from IHS Markit showed. The construction PMI rose to 50.1 in Sept from August's 62-month low of 46.3. Among sub-sectors, both commercial and civil engineering activity contracted in Sept. Commercial activity declined at the slowest pace in three months. New orders declined for the fifth straight month in Sept, but at a softer rate, mainly due to a lack of tender opportunities from the public sector. Job creation increased in the construction sector as outstanding works were high. Suppliers' delivery times deteriorated in Sept with a rise in purchasing. The cost of building material and products increased, but eased to the weakest since Feb 2016. (RTT)
HK: Private sector continues to shrink. Hong Kong’s private sector economy continued to contract in Sept as trade tensions and local protests continue to hurt demand, survey results from IHS Markit showed. The IHS Markit Hong Kong SAR PMI edged up to 41.5 in September from 40.8 in August. The score signaled the second steepest deterioration in the private sector activity since Feb 2009. Inflows of new work dropped at the second-steepest rate since Feb 2009, dragged down by another sharp decline in orders from mainland China. Although slower than in August, the fall in output in Sept was the second-fastest since early-2009. At the same time, employment decreased for the second month in a row. Further, a greater proportion of firms expressed pessimism about the year-ahead business outlook. (RTT)
Indonesia: Consumer confidence falls in September. Indonesia's consumer confidence fell in Sept, data from the Bank Indonesia showed. The consumer confidence index decreased to 121.8 in Sept from 123.1 in August. Consumers have remained upbeat based on their perception of current economic dynamics and due to growing expectations on future economic situation. Current economic conditions remained positive due to confidence in incomes, the bank said. Consumer perceptions regarding expectations on future income and job availability in the next 6 months increased in Sept. Households expect inflationary pressures to remain stable over the next 6 months. (RTT)

Market Update
The FBM KLCI might open higher today after an afternoon rally last Friday handed the S&P 500 its biggest one-day gain in nearly two months as the latest US jobs figures helped allay concerns about a domestic and global slowdown that have been brewing for most of the week. The S&P 500 finished 1.4% higher on Friday in a broad-based rally that lifted all sectors. It was the benchmark’s largest one-day rise since mid-August. The Nasdaq Composite and Dow Jones Industrial Average each closed 1.4% higher. That trimmed the S&P 500’s weekly decline to 0.3%, recovering some of the ground conceded earlier in the week when soft economic data triggered a sell-off across global stock markets. It was still the index’s third consecutive weekly drop. The gains in equities came in the wake of non-farm payroll data this morning that showed 136,000 jobs were added in September, from an upwardly-revised 168,000 in August, and the unemployment rate fell to 3.5% — its lowest in 50 years. The annual pace of wage growth cooled, though. Elsewhere in markets, European stocks finished higher, with the composite Stoxx 600 up 0.7%, Germany’s Dax up 0.7% and the Cac 40 in Paris up 0.9%. In London the FTSE 100 finished 1.1% higher, but still chalked up its biggest weekly fall in a year.
Back home, the FBM KLCI index lost 6.45 points or 0.41% on Friday. Trading volume decreased to 2.05bn worth RM1.60bn. Market breadth was negative with 404 gainers as compared to 409 losers. Hong Kong-listed equities fell as the city’s political crisis deepened, with chief executive Carrie Lam invoking emergency powers to ban protesters from wearing face masks. The territory’s Hang Seng index was down 1.1%, with new data showing business confidence in Hong Kong had slumped to a seven-and-a half year low following months of political unrest.

（吉隆坡4日讯）2019财政年盈利虽走低，顶级手套（TOPGLOV,7113,主板医疗保健组）仍有意维持6亿令吉资本开销，并预期明年业绩可取得双位数成长。
该公司执行主席丹斯理林伟才在全年业绩汇报会上表示，每当净利破新高时，公司净利会在短期内面对调整，因此2019财政年盈利表现只是正常调整而已。
2019财政年，顶级手套净利跌13%至3亿7400万令吉。
积极扩厂增产能
这家全球最大手套制造公司共有33座工厂，预期2020年底时将增至38座，生产线也会从目前的682条提高到876条，带动常年产量从639亿只提高到841亿只。
林伟才指出，新增的5座工厂皆为丁腈手套制造厂，因为市场对这类手套需求较高。
“全球人口增长及对生活要求日渐走高，是支撑手套需求成长的主要因素，预期来年业绩仍能取得10至20%的成长。”
有信心达30%市占率
林伟才强调，顶级手套的市占率为25至26%，有信心未来可取得30%的市占率。
林伟才有信心公司未来业绩能更好，2020财政年将拨出6亿令吉资本开销，预期80%用于提高丁腈手套产能。
目前，该公司每年生产300亿只丁腈手套，占总产能的50%。丁腈手套业务2019财政年为该公司贡献46%营收，比例超过乳胶粉手套（21%）、乳胶无粉手套（18%）和外科手术手套（12%）。
顶级手套旗下乙烯基（Vinly）手套业务营运亏损410万令吉，对比2018财政年，营运盈利破新高报2790万令吉。林伟才表示，乙烯基手套在中国生产，基于当地业者扩增产能，以至竞争激烈，因此，该业务计划转至越南工厂生产，因当地薪资成本较为廉宜。
继续并购
除了扩展产能，该公司也计划将部份资金用于合并与收购（M&A）。
对此林伟才并未透露收购细节，仅表示未来进行收购时，将更谨慎行事，因为他们已从过往事件得到经验。
2018年，顶级手套以13亿7000万令吉全购Aspion，获得每年8000万令吉盈利保证，却在7月爆出“贵买门”疑云爆发，指控刘振源等串谋欺诈，入禀马新两地法庭索偿至少7亿1486万2759令吉。
Aspion转亏为盈
对于Aspion，林伟才表示，顶级手套全面接管后，Aspion业务已逐渐改善，产能使用率虽低于60%，但已经成功转亏为盈，全年业绩从亏损210万令吉转至净利1960万令吉，净利赚幅为4%。
“在未来1年内，Aspion赚幅将与顶级手套相同。”
目前，顶级手套每百万只手套生产需要1.84名员工，对比2013时，则需要3.54名员工，归功于提升自动化程度之故。
“未来将持续提升自动化，包括使用人工智能检测手套质量、自动化包装及智能仓库，预期未来2年内全面竣工时，可再节约人力成本，幅度节约3至10%。”

Top Glove plans on enhancing the usage of technology to lessen physical manpower. With FY20 total estimated capital expenditure of RM600m, Top Glove plans to utilize it for automation, building new factories, expanding production capacity as well as M&A. We adjust our FY20-21 forecast downward by -5.5% and -5.8% after factoring in higher interest expense as well as expectations of lower nitrile ASP and margin pressure. We maintain BUY but with lower TP of RM5.02.
Recap. FY19 core PATAMI of RM382.4m (-14.6% YoY) accounted for 96% of ours and 93% of consensus estimates. FY19 dividend of 7.5 sen per share was declared (FY18: 8.5 sen per share). Even though FY19 revenue grew to RM4.8bn (+13.9% YoY) due to higher sales volume (+10% YoY), core PATAMI fell (-14.5%) due to time lag of cost-pass through mechanism and higher depreciation and interest costs.
Growth. FY19 revenue mix was mainly driven by nitrile gloves segment (46%) followed by latex powdered (21%), latex powder free (18%), surgical (12%), vinyl (2%) and cast polyethylene (CPE) and thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) (1%). On the other hand, FY19 sales volume growth showed +10% (YoY) improvement especially thanks to improvement in nitrile (+30%) and surgical segment (+46%), the growth was slightly pulled back by the weaker vinyl (-29%) and latex powdered segment (-5%).
ASP. YoY, ASP for nitrile segment showed an improvement of +6% while NR segment improved slightly (+2% YoY). As for vinyl gloves; the intense competition has resulted in lower ASPs since February 19, nevertheless in the past 6 months, ASP has stabilized and continues to improve. However, while the organic demand for gloves is estimated at 8-10%, Top Glove is expected to increase its capacity to 84.1bn pieces per annum by FY20 (+31.6%), hence we foresee that margin recovery could be prolonged further.
Industry 4.0. Top Glove plans on utilizing technology to further automate and digitalize production lines to reduce reliance on workers and improve quality and efficiency. This is done through implementations of new technology into existing and new factories via; (i) Artificial Intelligence (AI) Vision Camera for online detection and removal of defective gloves (expected to reduce 10% manpower when fully implemented by CY20), (ii) advance auto packing machine (expected 4% reduction in manpower when fully implemented by CY21) and (iii) smart warehouse with AGVs (automated guided vehicle) (expected 3% reduction in manpower when it begins commencement by CY20). Thanks to automation, Top Glove has recorded a 48% reduction (from FY13) of number of workers per million pieces of gloves.
Outlook. Top Glove total estimated capital expenditure for FY20 is about RM600m which will be used for automation, building new factories, expanding production capacity (80% of expansionary capex will be used for nitrile glove segment) as well as M&As. By CY20, Top Glove is projected to have 38 factories with 876 production lines. Top Glove is strengthening their focus on the nitrile glove segment; and has increased its nitrile capacity by 54% over the past 2 years, with plans to grow further. Apart from that, they are putting efforts at diversifying into other business such as condom manufacturing and dental dam.
Forecast. We cut FY20-21 forecast by -5.5% and -5.8% after factoring expectation of lower nitrile ASP due to expected capacity of 84.1bn pieces per annum by FY20 (+31.6% YoY) (above the 8-10% demand growth for gloves), and higher interest expense. ASP recovery in nitrile gloves will be longer than protracted in our view, in light of the continuous capacity expansion (80% of expansionary capex to be used for nitrile segment) expected in FY20.
Maintain BUY, with a lower TP of RM5.02 (from RM5.31). Our TP is based on FY20 earnings pegged to a PE multiple of 26x. We like Top Glove for its diverse product mix and its prime position to chip away market share.

The FBM KLCI posted back-to-back losses, mostly dragged down by KLK (- RM1.54) following a sizable off-market deal and Indonesia’s investigation into Malaysian-linked plantation companies for alleged open burning activities. Similarly, the key-index (-1.7% W.o.W) also marked its third consecutive losses amid the prevailing negative sentiment. The lower liners were mostly in the red, together with the majority of the broader market, although the FBM Small Cap managed to end higher on Friday.
Market breadth was lacklustre as losers closely matched the winners on a ratio of 409-to-404 stocks. Traded volumes, meanwhile, fell 6.0% to 2.05 bln shares as global growth prospects remain bleak.
Plantation giant Kuala Lumpur Kepong (-RM1.54) led the heavyweights laggards, followed by Nestle (-40.0 sen), Petronas Chemicals (-16.0 sen), Tenaga Nasional (-6.0 sen) and Ambank (-5.0 sen). Meanwhile, broader market losers included United Plantations (-40.0 sen), Aeon Credit (-20.0 sen), UMS (-14.0 sen), Bintulu Port (-9.0 sen) and Harrisons (-8.0 sen).
On the other hand, semicon players like KESM (+48.0 sen), Vitrox (+33.0 sen), Malaysian Pacific Industries (+21.0 sen) and Unisem (+16.0 sen) were amongst the outperformers, together with Guan Chong Bhd (+17.0 sen). Notable bluechip winners, meanwhile, include Hong Leong Financial Group (+16.0 sen), Petronas Gas (+10.0 sen), Genting Malaysia (+8.0 sen), Hartalega (+6.0 sen) and Maxis (+5.0 sen).
Key benchmark regional stockmarkets were mostly muted as investors awaited the upcoming U.S. employment data after being spooked by soft data releases from earlier of the week. The Nikkei (+0.3%) toed the breakeven line after a late turnaround, on the back of the gains in the energy sector. The Hang Seng Index (-1.1%), meanwhile, closed lower, weighed down by escalated political unrest amid the ongoing public protests. Chinese markets were closed for a public holiday, while ASEAN stockmarkets finished mostly higher.
Wall Street rallied as investors cheered favorable employment numbers, ahead of renewed U.S.-China trade discussion this week. The Dow and the S&P 500 gained 1.4% on Friday, despite extending its losses for the third-straight week, while the Nasdaq (+1.4%) also ended positively.
Key European benchmark indices reported gains, taking cue from the positive sentiment spilled over from their U.S. counterparts. The FTSE close 1.1% higher, buoyed by a weaker Pound, while the DAX and the CAC rose 0.7% and 0.9% higher respectively. THE DAY AHEAD
It was another disappointing session on Bursa Malaysian as stocks continue to head south amid the country’s weak export performance that weigh on sentiments that is also seeing more foreign players exiting the Malaysian equity market.
Under the prevailing environment, the FBM KLCI’s outlook is still one of filled with uncertainty as there continues to be unabated selling on the index heavyweights. However, we think the selling is already overdone as it is already oversold from the recent selling. Therefore, there are some mild some bargain hunting activities that could allow for some reprieve but the upsides could be limited as market players will be adopting a wait-and-see approach ahead of the Budget 2020 announcement at the end of the week. On the upside, the key index may target the resistances at the 1,565 and 1,572 levels. The supports are at 1,551 and 1,532 points respectively.
Unlike the key index stocks, however, the lower liners are on a purple patch, helped by gains on rotational interest on technology stocks even as the exports of E&E products dipped. As the buying momentum on these stocks remains firm, we see further near term upsides on the lower liners, albeit the buying interest is still on the thin side. COMPANY BRIEF

We believe the earnings recovery is priced in and maintain estimates and HOLD rating post TOP GLOVE CORPORATION BHD's management analyst briefing. We forecast a 20% q-o-q increase in 1QFY8/20 net profit driven by higher sales volume and profit margins for latex gloves due to eased competition.
Maintain HOLD and Target Price of MYR4.30 based on an unchanged 26x P/E on CY20F (10% discount to our target P/E for Hartalega).
Our preferred pick is Kossan (BUY, Target Price MYR5.10) for its exposure to the non-medical segment and undemanding CY20F P/E of 22x.
Strong Sales Volume, Latex ASP Competition Eased
Key takeaways from the analyst briefing:
Latex glove demand has improved on better global demand and more disciplined pricing by competitor Sri Trang Agro-Industry (SGX:NC2);
Demand for nitrile gloves is strong with sales lead time 50-60 days from 30-45 days;
Management targets PBT margin of 10-12% for Aspion in 6-12 months (FY19: 1%) on cost reductions and slightly higher plant utilisation rate (sub-60% now);
New vinyl glove plant in Vietnam will commence its first line in 2Q20 (capacity of 4b pcs p.a.) and the production cost is 20% lower than its China’s vinyl glove plant (4QFY19: MYR4m EBIT loss).
Has China Re-routed Its Supply to Other Markets?
The strong demand for nitrile gloves could be due to stronger U.S. imports following its 15% tariff on China’s rubber examination gloves since Sep 2019. The U.S. tariff may also result in China re-routing its supply to other markets (e.g. Europe).
While Top Glove has yet to feel any ASP pressure in other markets, we understand from certain local player that there is already some ASP pressure in Europe.
ASP Competition in Latex Segment May Recur
We also caution that intense ASP competition may recur as Sri Trang is still ramping up its new capacity of 3b pcs p.a. (+14% to 24b pcs p.a.), with the full commercialisation targeted for 4Q19. It also plans to add another 6b pcs p.a. capacity (+25% to 30b pcs p.a.) by end-2020.

While acknowledging that the ban would tarnish the good image of Malaysian glove makers, Top Glove chairman Tan Sri Dr Lim Wee Chai said the US had sent the right signal to global businesses.
""This is a signal to all factories or businesses. If we want to do business with other countries like the US or (in) Europe, we have to comply with the international rules and improve ourselves.
""And it is a good direction and a wake up call for Malaysian factories or companies, ” he told reporters on the sidelines of the company’s FY19 and Q4 2019 results briefing here, today.
The US recently blocked the import of disposable rubber gloves from a Malaysian company, WRP Asia Pacific Sdn Bhd, suspected to have been manufactured using forced labour.
Asked if the ban would affect Top Glove’s sales to the US, Lim quipped: ""So far so good. Of course, from time to time we might face some problems, but they (the US) have sent the right direction and we will move towards it.”
Top Glove’s sales to North America surged 20.3 per cent year-on-year (y-o-y) in the financial year ended Aug 31,2019 (FY19), while that of Western Europe rose 12.7 per cent y-o-y and Japan increased 24.0 per cent y-o-y.
On the 2020 Budget wishlist, Lim expressed hope that the government could provide more reinvestment allowance for factories to grow further.
He also hoped that the government would spend more money on research and development, automation, and industrialisation to enable manufacturers to embrace the Industrial Revolution 4.0.
""We need a smart government to come out with a smart budget, ” he added.
The 2020 Budget will be tabled in Parliament on Oct 11,2019. - Bernama

However, we do not think such an action will have an adverse impact on the entire sector, as the Withhold Release Order (WRO) used by the CBP is for the specific company only (WRP). Weak sector sentiment may, however, offer an opportunity to accumulate our top buy ideas for the sector - Kossan and Supermax.
News About the Forced Labour Is Not New
The allegation of forced labour in the Malaysian rubber products sector is not new, as it was first reported by the UK press in end-2018 and early-2019, whereby they had identified 3 companies which had engaged in such. WRP Asia Pacific Sdn Bhd (WRP), whose gloves were recently seized by the CBP, was one of the 3 companies that was identified by the press. Although Top Glove and Karex were also mentioned back then, we believe that the recent changes implemented by the latter two have managed to address most, if not all, of the concerns. The resulting higher labour costs arising from the changes were already reflected in their P&Ls since 1Q19.
Definition of Forced Labour Varies From Country to Country
The biggest challenge for Malaysian companies to avert these allegations results from the continuously changing standards, as the definition of forced labour varies across countries. Our recent checks with the companies under our coverage indicated that they are in compliance with Malaysian regulations, and are subjected to social-compliance audits by their customers from time to time. Most of them have also engaged social activists to conduct independent audits in order to be in compliance with international standards. Ultimately, the companies have limited the maximum allowable overtime (OT) to 104 hours a month (average 4 hours a day) for all their workers.
Automation Is the Way Forward
The increase in labour costs has been relatively steep since the introduction of the minimum wage in 2014, and manufacturers have introduced automation to reduce labour dependency. We believe the increased scrutiny on the sector’s labour practices is likely to speed up the whole automation process. Although the government does provide grants to help with the changes, it is relatively insignificant to the overall investment that the manufacturers need. We believe that the larger manufacturers might be able to increase their market share at the expense of the smaller manufacturers as some of them are unable to invest in automation.
Kossan and Supermax Are Our Top Picks
We believe that the direct impact from the seizure of WRP’s gloves is relatively limited, as the producers would still be able to sell their products in other countries. According to our checks, WRP has an estimated production capacity of 11bn pcs/year (around 5% of Malaysia’s overall capacity), with focus on the nitrile and surgical glove segment. As the overall impact to the sector is relatively limited, we are maintaining our Neutral call on the sector. Kossan (KRI) and Supermax (SUCB) are our top BUYs for the sector, due to their undemanding valuations and higher-thanindustry growth rates. We have SELL calls on Top Glove (TOPG), Hartalega (HART) and Karex (KAREX) due to their rich valuations.

In line with 1.3% or 343 pts skid on Dow, Asian markets ended lower as sluggish US manufacturing data stoked fears of a global economic slowdown and reignited concern over the impact of the US-China trade war. To recap, ISM said US manufacturing activity tumbled to more than 10-year low in September, underscored the damaging effects of the prolonged trade war with China. Major losers were KOSPI (-2%), ASX 200 (-1.5%), Indonesia (-1.4%) and Singapore (-1.4%).
Tracking weak regional markets, KLCI tumbled 14.5 at 1574.9, led by selldown in banking (PBBANK, MAYBANK and HLBANK) and telco (MAXIS and DIGI) stocks. Trading volume increased to 1.85bn shares worth RM1.44bn as compared to Tuesday’s 1.80bn shares worth RM1.27bn. Market breadth was negative with 265 gainers as compared to 516 losers.
The Dow plunged 494 pts or 1.9% at 26078, with a back-to-back slide of more than 3.2% or 837 pts. The slump was triggered by nagging worries about political turmoil and growing signs of domestic weakness following the release of bearish ISM manufacturing report on Monday, sending investors scurrying for cover in safe assets (US 10Y yield -0.04% to 1.6%).
TECHNICAL OUTLOOK: KLCI
After slipping below multiple key SMAs and 1581 (15 Aug low) supports coupled with overnight 1.9% slump on Dow, KLCI is expected to witness a selling spree towards lower supports at 1571 (14 May low), 1564 (weekly low BB) and 1550 levels, reflected by the long black candlestick with bearish MACD and falling RSI. Stiff resistances are pegged at 1589 (10D SMA) and 1600 psychological barrier.
In wake of a bearish 2-day slide from Dow, KLCI is expected to witness another day of selling spree today. Sentiment is likely to remain tepid amid anxieties over earnings disappointments and the uncertain outlook of Malaysian government bonds (still on the Watch List for potential downgrade pending the next review in March 2020) as investors await the crucial US-China trade talks on 10-11 Oct and the tabling of Budget 2020. Overall, we will likely see defensive yield seeking to be the dominant investment style in the near term. We continue to favour high divvy yielders (defensive and low MGS yield) and exporters (depreciation bias to ringgit). HLIB top picks are KLCCSS, TM, LIIHEN, TOPGLOV and MAYBANK.
TECHNICAL OUTLOOK: DOW JONES
After hitting 1M high of 27306 (12 Sep), the Dow uptrend reversed slid to a low of 25974 (slightly above 200SD SMA at 25840) before ending at 26078. Following the multiple key SMAs supports breakdown and the two bearish Marubozu candlesticks, the Dow is likely to remain under siege with critical support at 200D SMA. A decisive fall below 25840 will trigger more selloff towards 25000-25300 territory. Stiff resistances are pegged at 26300-26600 zones.
We maintain our view that the Dow will continue its choppy mode with critical downside support near 200D SMA or 25840 levels as investors await the next course of actions by the Fed on 30-31 Oct and 10-11 Dec FOMC meetings following recent bearish set of US and global economic data, as well as closely monitoring the upcoming trade talks on 10-11 Oct. In addition, traders will be shifting their attention towards the upcoming US 3Q19 reporting season in mid Oct (consensus is predicting the S&P 500 earnings to decline 4.8% YoY from a flat performance in Q1 and Q2).

Our investment case is based on: (i) our analysis that the new capacity expansion industry-wide is slower-than-expected, which should help maintain the supply-demand equilibrium, (ii) expected earnings growth driven by new capacity expansion and higher ASPs, and (iii) US-led uptick in demand due to trade war where the US accounts for between 28%-55% of glove players group sales. Due to the intense competition in the latex segment, we would focus on players which are largely nitrile-centric including HARTA and KOSSAN. We have OUTPERFORM calls on HARTA (OP; TP: RM5.85); KOSSAN (OP; TP: RM5.25) and SUPERMX (OP; TP: RM1.75). Our Top Pick in the sector is HARTA (OP; TP: RM5.85). We like HARTA for: (i) its “highly automated production processes” model, which is moving from ‘good’ to ‘great’ as they are head and shoulders above peers in terms of better margins and costs reduction, (ii) constantly evolving via innovative products development, and (iii) its nitrile gloves segment, which is booming.
2QCY19 results were a mixed bag. The recent 2QCY19 results season for glove makers under our coverage came in mixed. The star performer was Kossan which recorded a 30% YoY net profit growth, underpinned by new capacity expansion in plant 16, 17 and 18. Hartalega saw a small sequential growth in 1Q20 (FYE Mar), we are expecting better performance in subsequent quarters on the back of uptick in demand and potential margins expansion emanating from operating efficiency and better economies of scale due to increased capacity and higher volume sales. Supermax’s 4Q19 was hit by competition in the latex segment and an up-trending input rubber latex price and a one-off cost which dragged down overall 4Q19 bottom-line. Top Glove suffered 2nd consecutive quarterly earnings disappointment.
Expect US demand to surge from trade-war effect. Due to the impact of trade war whereby effective Sept 1, a 15% tariff will be imposed on Chinese-made medical and vinyl gloves, local rubber glove players expect to see an uptick in demand for gloves of which the positive impact is expected to be felt from the Dec-ending quarter period. Theoretically, the tariff hike is expected to increase the price for Chinese-made gloves, which could compel a switch of US gloves demand to Malaysia glove players where US accounts for between 28%-55% of glove players’ group sales.
Uptick in nitrile demand but intense competition for latex to hit margin. Looking ahead, the keen competition in the latex segment could negatively impact latex gloves margin. The robust demand for nitrile gloves has led to longer delivery lead times to between 45 to 50 days as compared to 30 to 40 days previously. Although we are positive on growth in subsequent quarters underpinned by uptick in nitrile demand driven by re-stocking activities, players like TOPGLOV and SUPERMX could continue to be plagued with competitive pressure from low margin latex gloves (accounts for estimated 50% of product mix for both players) which could offset the gains in the nitrile segment. Investors should focus on nitrile-centric players. Due to the intense competition in the latex segment, we recommend players which are largely nitrile-centric including HARTA and KOSSAN which product mixes hinge largely towards nitrile at 95% and 75% share, respectively. Conversely, TOPGLOV and SUPERMX which are largely latex-centric with product mix between nitrile and latex are estimated at 50% : 50% are expected to face margins pressure.
Oversupply concerns overplayed, ASPs pressure temporary rough patch. From our analysis, there are nascent signs indicating that oversupply concerns appear overplayed considering that capacity expansions of the four rubber gloves under coverage are expected to be delayed and staggered. In the last two years, the sector has become a victim of its own success. The frantic pace of capacity expansion has resulted in a mild excess supply for rubber gloves leading to ASP compressions and flattish or lower profits over the past two quarters. However, with the rubber gloves players becoming aware of the intense competition since four months ago, measures were taken to mitigate the impact of competition including; (i) slowing new capacity expansion, (ii) measures to maintain margins, including automation and other cost reduction initiatives, and (iii) intensifying sales efforts to penetrate emerging economies.
Our Top Pick in the sector is HARTALEGA. We like HARTA for: (i) its “highly automated production processes” model, which is moving from ‘good’ to ‘great’ as they are head and shoulders above its peers in terms of better margins and reduction in costs, (ii) constantly evolving via innovative products development, and (iii) its nitrile gloves segment, which is booming. Our TP is RM5.85 based on unchanged 36x CY20 EPS (at +1.0SD above 5-year historical forward mean).
Maintain OP on Kossan. We like Kossan because it is trading at an unwarranted 28% discount to peers’ PER average considering that its net profit growth is the highest at 23.7% compared to peers average at 7%. Our TP is RM5.25 based on 25.5x FY20E EPS (+1.0SD above 5-year historical forward mean).

On RM outlook, despite abating risk of WGBI exclusion for now (pending further review in March 2020), the greenback strength and BNM’s easing bias (HLIB forecast a 25bps OPR cut within the next 6 months and keeps a 4.15-4.20 range/USD), USDMYR is expected to move alongside USDCNY (also on weakening tone) towards RM4.23-4.28 territory in the next 3-6 months (technical view). Given the weak ringgit undertone, we reckon that export plays could return. HLIB top picks are Top Glove (BUY: TP RM5.31, DY: 2.3%) and Lii Hen (BUY: TP RM4.22, DY: 5.3%).
Still weakening bias towards RM4.23-4.28 zones. After strengthening 1.5% briefly from 22M high of RM4.23 (29 Aug) to RM4.167 (13 Sep low), ringgit (vs USD) eased 0.5% again to close at RM4.189 yesterday to hold firmly above 120D/200D SMAs. This together with the with a bullish weekly symmetric triangle formation bode well for further ringgit depreciation towards RM4.21 (daily high BB) and RM4.23 zones before heading towards LT objective at RM4.28 (monthly high BB). On a flip side, a decisive violation below RM4.162 (120D SMA) and RM4.136 (200D SMA) levels would augur well for the currency to recover at RM4.104 (19 July low) territory.

Comfort Gloves Bhd’s (CGB) 2QFY20 net profit surged 73.8% Y.o.Y to RM7.1 mln, from RM4.1 mln previously, owing to a stronger revenue of RM117.6 mln (+7.1% Y.o.Y) vs. RM109.8 mln a year ago, as well as lower logistics costs incurred due to the FDA issue last year that resulted in higher logistic cost.
Cumulative 1HFY20 net profit grew 35.7% Y.o.Y to RM15.5 mln, from RM11.4 mln in the same period last year, on the back of lower selling and marketing as well as administrative expenses. Revenue also rose 9.8% Y.o.Y to RM15.5 mln, from RM11.4 mln in 1HFY19.
The latest earnings met our expectations with net profit accounting for 47.8% of our full-year net profit, while revenue accounted for 51.8% of our estimated sales. With that, we keep our forecasts unchanged for now.
Downside risks to our forecast include slowing global economies due to ongoing U.S.- China trade conflicts that could result in volatilities in latex prices and higher financing costs as we saw a higher gearing of 0.3x in FY19. Previously, CGB has been in a net cash position for the past five consecutive years.
Prospects
Currently, CGB should be running at an average utilisation rate of around 80%-90%; which is expected to continue even as the group adds on new capacity.
Moving forward, we remain confident of CGB’s ability to churn out positive bottomline growth, following stronger EBITDA margin that is driven by lower operating expenses, lower raw materials prices and the strengthening Greenback. Certainly, full-year results will outperform FY19’s due to low base effect, while controlled capacity expansion by major players buoyed selling prices.
On the downside, we are also aware of rising business costs, i.e.: utilities and raw materials will impact margins, albeit we believe that it is still manageable given CGB’s position as a premium glove maker and resilient demand for rubber gloves worldwide.
Valuation and Recommendation
We maintain our BUY recommendation on CGB with an unchanged target price of RM0.95 by ascribing to an unchanged target PER of 17.0x to its FY20 (unchanged) EPS of 5.6 sen, driven by higher sales volumes, improving margins and resilient demand for gloves.
Our positive call is premised on its still attractive valuations that are also backed by its firm operational strength that will sustain its earnings growth over the next two years.
The ascribed target PER remains at a discount to the PER of industry bellwethers like Hartalega Holdings Bhd and Top Glove Corporation Bhd due to CGB’s smaller market capitalisation and capacity.
Potential downside risks to our call include labour abuse allegations, unexpected fluctuations in latex prices and forex movements.

Malaysian stocks ended the week on a dour note, hampered by renewed selling despite FTSE Russell providing another six month’s grace for Malaysian government bonds to meet liquidity requirements to stay on the World Bond Index. The selling was also widespread with most sub-indices ending the week on a dour note, except for the FBM Fledgling Index.
Market breadth was decidedly negative with losers overwhelming the gainers 483-to-287 stocks. Market participation also remained thin with just 1.88 bln shares changing hands, some 4.0% more than the previous day’s volume as most market players continue to stay on the sidelines amid the lack of fresh catalysts.
The main losers were AEON Credit (-60.0 sen) after the release of weaker results, followed by Hai O (-47.0 sen), BAT (-36.0 sen) and Carlsberg (-32.0 sen). Among FBM KLCI listed stocks, Top Glove (- 12.0 sen) fell after reporting reduced earnings, while Hong Leong Financial Group (-28.0 sen) and Petronas Gas (- 10.0 sen) were among the other big losers.
Key index gainers, meanwhile, were Tenaga (+18.0 sen), Petronas Dagangan (+12.0 sen) and Maxis (+3.0 sen). In the broader market, the winners include Dutch Lady (+42.0 sen), Pentamaster (+22.0 sen) and Scientex (+11.0 sen) – the latter continuing to gain ground after it reported stronger earnings for FY19.
Asian equities reversed their gains a day earlier, taking cue from the weaker Wall Street overnight. The Nikkei shed 0.8%, falling to its two-week low, spooked by president Trump’s impeachment concerns. The Hang Seng (-0.3%) also fell on concerns over sustained antigovernment protest over the weekend. China stocks, however, ended the week with marginal gains. Elsewhere, ASEAN stocks were broadly lower, with only Thai stocks making headway for the day.
U.S. stocks retreated last Friday after President Trump is said to be considering limiting investments into and from China that could ratchet up the already frail political conditions between the two countries. This saw the Dow falling 0.3%, while the broader S&P 500 eased 0.5%.
Key European indices, however, gained ground on firmer performances from mining companies that helped the FTSE climb 1.0%. Meanwhile, the CAC rose 0.4% and the DAX gained 0.8% to end the week on a positive note.
The Day Ahead
Although we expected stocks to react positively to the extension granted by FTSE Russell for Malaysian government bonds to meet the listing requirements, the renewed selling was overwhelming to send stocks lower instead.
It would appear that market players are still unconvinced of Malaysian stocks near term direction with the bearish trend sustaining amid the lack of fresh buying. Consequently, we think that the near term outlook will remain and the key index is still poised for further downside bias over the near term.
As it is, the broad market conditions are staying dour with fewer impetuses to drive market sentiments and this could also mean that the key index could retest the 1,580 level again. If the level also fails to hold, the year low of 1,572 level could be retested. The resistances, on the other hand, are at the 1,590-1,600 levels.
 Although the FBM Small Cap is remaining largely rangebound, there are also few impetuses to sustain the buying momentum and we also think that the mixed-to-lower trend is likely to continue for now. The same conditions could also prevail in the other broader market and lower liner shares.
Company Update
Comfort Gloves Bhd’s (CGB) 2QFY20 net profit surged 73.8% Y.o.Y to RM7.1 mln, from RM4.1 mln previously, owing to a stronger revenue of RM117.6 mln (+7.1% Y.o.Y) vs. RM109.8 mln a year ago as well as lower logistics costs incurred due to the FDA issue last year.
Also, cumulative 1HFY20 net profit grew 35.7% Y.o.Y to RM15.5 mln, from RM11.4 mln in the same period last year, on the back of lower selling and marketing, as well as administrative expenses. Revenue also rose 9.8% Y.o.Y to RM15.5 mln, from RM11.4 mln in 1HFY19.
Comments
The latest earnings met our expectations with net profit accounting for 47.8% of our full-year net profit, while revenue accounted for 51.8% of our estimated sales. With that, we keep our forecasts unchanged for now.
We also maintain our BUY recommendation on CGB with an unchanged target price of RM0.95 by ascribing to an unchanged target price of 17.0x to its FY20 EPS of 5.6 sen, driven by higher sales volumes, improving margins and resilient demand for gloves.
The ascribed target PER remains at a discount to the PER of industry bellwethers like Hartalega Holdings Bhd and Top Glove Corporation Bhd due to CGB’s smaller market capitalisation and capacity.
Kim Loong Resources Bhd’s 2QFY20 net profit fell 13.3% Y.o.Y to RM10.4 mln, dragged down by the decline in average selling prices (ASP) of fresh fruit bunches (FFB) and crude palm oil (CPO), coupled with approximately one month operational disruption at its Kota Tinggi mill. Revenue for the quarter decreased 26.6% Y.o.Y to RM154.3 mln.
For 1HFY20, cumulative net profit slipped 22.5% Y.o.Y to RM24.9 mln. Revenue for the period contracted 27.6% Y.o.Y to RM323.3 mln.
Comments
The results came in below expectations with its net profit only amounting to 32.5% of our previous full-year forecast of RM76.7 mln, while its revenue also came below our expectations, amounting to 36.9% of our previous FY20 estimate of RM876.5 mln. The bottom line’s variance is due to the lower CPO average selling prices.
As the reported earnings came below our expectations, we trimmed our net profit forecast by 19.2% and 3.4% to RM61.5 mln and RM76.8 mln for FY20 and FY21 respectively to account for disruption of Kota Tinggi mill production, coupled with the lower turnover from the slowdown in global demand growth.
Despite that, we maintain our HOLD recommendation on KLR, with an unchanged target price of RM1.15 as we rolled over our valuation metrics to FY21. Our target price is derived by ascribing an unchanged target PER of 14.0x to its revised FY21 EPS of 8.2 sen. The ascribed target PER is in line with the industry average of around 13.5x-15.5x.
COMPANY BRIEF
Gamuda Bhd's 4QFY19 net profit stood at RM185.0 mln vs. a net loss of RM103.6 mln recorded in the previous corresponding quarter, bolstered by the strong property sales in Vietnam that cushioned the impact of lower income from its construction division. Revenue for the quarter rose 23.7% Y.o.Y to RM1.50 bln.
For FY19, cumulative net profit grew 33.2% Y.o.Y to RM706.1 mln. Revenue for the year rose 8.3% Y.o.Y to RM4.57 bln. (The Star Online)

Hiap Teck Venture Bhd’s 4QFY19 net profit stood at RM29.6 mln vs. a net loss of RM20.0 mln recorded in the previous corresponding quarter, thanks to higher share in profits from a joint venture. Revenue for the quarter, however, declined 4.8% Y.o.Y to RM309.9 mln.
For FY19, cumulative net profit declined 9.5% to RM25.3 mln. Revenue for the year, however, grew 5.2% Y.o.Y to RM1.19 bln. A first and final dividend of 0.5 sen for FY19 was declared. (The Edge Daily)

最新进展
顶级手套（TOPGLOV，7113，主板保健股）截至今年8月底2019财年末季，净利跌13.3%，至8005万2000令吉，归咎于竞争剧烈，但仍建议派发每股4仙股息。
末季营业额小滑2.78%，降低至11亿8959万4000令吉。
全年来看，净利少赚12.68%，报3亿7056万4000令吉，而营业额年扬13.77%，至48亿175万9000令吉。
行家建议
顶级手套全年净利低于预期，仅分别达我们和市场预测89.3%与90.8%，归咎于天然胶手套销量趋低。虽胶价走跌可抵消部分不利，但我们还是下修2020财年财测2.7%。
无论如何，橡胶手套制造前景仍强劲，预计今年杪丁腈手套产能可增至每年142亿只，崛起为全球最大丁腈手套制造商。
由于医疗条规越来越严格，我们相信一次性医疗手套需求会稳定增长，支撑前景。
此外，该公司也积极多元化现有产品，将会是很好的竞争优势。不过，融资成本料会保持高位，因为顶级手套是通过贷款来扩充。
另外，该公司周息率仅1.9%，股价上涨空间比其他同行更有限。
综合来看，我们维持“中和”评级，并下修目标价至4.58令吉，相等于2020财年本益比25倍。

FY19 vs FY18:
在2019财年，集团的销售收入为48亿令吉，比2018财年增长13.8％，而销量也比上一年增长10％。强劲的销售量增长主要来自丁腈手套业务，增长了约30％，外科手套业务增长了46％。
尽管新兴市场的需求继续呈上升趋势，但需求增长百分比与2018财年相比较低，在2018财年，顶级手套经历了多年来最强劲的增长。丁腈手套业务表现出色，销售量强劲增长约30％，利润率有所提高。这主要归因于新的和技术更先进的丁腈手套工厂的产品质量提高和效率水平提高以及自动化程度的提高。为了加强对丁腈手套的关注，该集团在过去两年中将丁腈产能提高了54％，并计划进一步发展。
虽然天然橡胶胶乳的平均价格从2018财年的4.51令吉/公斤下降了8.6％至2019财年的4.12令吉/公斤，但在本财政年度的几个月中呈指数级增长，在9 April 2019达到顶峰的5.11令吉/公斤。但是，它目前呈下降趋势价格为每公斤4.38令吉（截至2019年9月26日），预计价格将在20财年第1季度降低。与此同时，丁腈乳胶的平均价格从2018财年的1.13美元/千克下降至2019财年的1.11美元/千克，微幅下降了1.8％。
4Q19 vs 3Q19:
除税前溢利减少1.2％，而除税后溢利则增加6.5％。丁腈手套部门的利润贡献也有所增加，但被乙烯基手套部门的亏损以及天然橡胶手套部门的较低利润贡献所抵消。由于19财年3季度销售价格上调生效，天然橡胶手套的利润率有所改善。在从未使用税损失和津贴中确认递延税项资产后，顶级手套在2019财年第四季度也享受较低的税收优惠。
前景：
顶级手套将继续寻求扩张，以满足全球手套需求的增长，全球手套需求将以每年10％的速度增长。这将使集团的生产线总数增加194条，年产能增加202亿只手套，相当于增加32％的产能。到2020年12月，Top Glove预计将拥有876条生产线，年产手套为841亿只。
为了强调他们对可持续发展的承诺，他们成立了董事会可持续发展委员会，由5名非执行董事组成，以使他们能够在这个日益重要的领域取得有意义的进步。他们继续加强其举措，特别是在劳工实践领域，其重点包括以下内容：
a）实施零招聘费政策，根据该政策，公司承担其外籍工人招聘成本的100％。
b）制定为期5年的“多元化与共融路线图”，以进一步加强他们在这一领域的实践。
c）引入“零伤害计划”，根据该计划，工厂将拥有一个指定的且设备齐全的急救角，该角已实施。
他们还推出了其旗舰绿色产品BioGreen™可生物降解的丁腈手套（无粉），与传统的丁腈检查手套相比，其生物降解速度至少快10倍。此外，顶级手套被列入2019年9月道琼斯可持续发展指数（DJSI）新兴市场的指数成分。
此外，Top Glove在本财政年度中还获得了数个著名的奖项，包括在2018年MSWG东盟企业管治奖中获得了行业卓越奖（医疗保健）。该公司还在2019年《亚洲货币》亚洲杰出公司民意调查中被评为马来西亚最杰出公司（工业领域）。
展望未来，Top Glove对公司以及整个行业的前景都保持乐观，观察到对手套的需求仍然强劲，如销售和销量增长所证明。随着持续的质量，自动化和流程改进计划的到位，Top Glove仍然对在下一个财政年度取得更好的表现感到乐观。

[TOP GLOVE CORP BHD: This will boost the Group’s total number of production lines by an additional 194 lines and production capacity by 20.2 billion gloves per annum, represent an increase of 32% in capacity, by December 2020, Top Glove is projected to have 876 production lines and a production capacity of 84.1 billion gloves per annum]
FY19 vs FY18:
For FY2019, the Group posted Sales Revenue of RM4.8 billion, an increase of 13.8% over FY2018, while Sales Volume also rose 10% compared with the previous year. The strong Sales Volume growth resulted mainly from the nitrile glove segment which saw a surge of about 30% and surgical glove segment which grew by 46%.
While demand in emerging markets continues to trend upward, the percentage of increase in demand recorded was lower compared with FY2018, during which the Group had experienced its strongest growth in many years. The nitrile glove segment has delivered a markedly better performance with strong Sales Volume growth of about 30% and improved profit margins recorded. This was largely attributed to improved product quality and higher efficiency levels from newer and more technologically advanced nitrile glove factories, with increased automation. Towards strengthening their focus on the nitrile glove segment, the Group has increased its nitrile capacity by 54% over the past 2 years, with plans to grow further.
While the average natural rubber latex price fell 8.6% from RM4.51/kg in FY2018 to RM4.12/kg in FY2019, it had increased exponentially over the course of several months within the financial year, peaking at RM5.11/kg on 9 April 2019. However, it is on a downward trend and currently at RM4.38/kg (as at 26/09/2019), with prices expected to be lower by 1QFY20. Meanwhile, the average nitrile latex price decreased slightly 1.8% from USD 1.13/kg in FY2018 to USD 1.11/kg in FY2019.
4Q19 vs 3Q19:
Profit Before Tax eased by 1.2% while Profit After Tax increased by 6.5%. Profit contribution from the nitrile glove segment also increased, but was offset by losses in the vinyl glove segment as well as lower profit contribution from the natural rubber glove segment. An improvement in the profit margin for natural rubber gloves was recorded as a result of the upward revision in selling price in 3QFY19 came into effect. The Group also enjoyed lower taxation in 4QFY19 following the recognition of deferred tax assets from unutilised tax losses and allowances.
Prospects:
The Group will continue pursuing expansion in order to meet the increase in global glove demand which is set to grow by 10% yearly. This will boost the Group’s total number of production lines by an additional 194 lines and production capacity by 20.2 billion gloves per annum, represent an increase of 32% in capacity. By December 2020, Top Glove is projected to have 876 production lines and a production capacity of 84.1 billion gloves per annum.
Underscoring their commitment to sustainability, they established a Board Sustainability Committee comprising 5 of their Non-Executive Directors, to enable them to make meaningful strides in this increasingly important space. They continue to step up their initiatives particularly in the area of labour practices, the highlights of which include the following:
a) Implementing the Zero Recruitment Fee Policy under which the company bears 100% of its foreign workers’ recruitment costs.
b) Developing a 5-year Diversity & Inclusion Roadmap to further enhance their practices in this area.
c) Introducing the “Zero Harm Programme” under which factories will have a designated and well-equipped First Aid Corner, which has since been implemented.
They also launched their flagship green product, BioGreen™ Biodegradable Nitrile Gloves (Powder-Free), which are proven to biodegrade at least 10 times faster compared to conventional nitrile examination gloves. In addition, Top Glove was included as an index component of the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (DJSI) for Emerging Markets in September 2019.
In addition, Top Glove was honoured with several prestigious awards over the course of the financial year, including the Industry Excellence Award (Healthcare) at the MSWG Asean Corporate Governance Award 2018. The company was also named the Most Outstanding Company in Malaysia (Industrials Sector) in 2019 Asiamoney Asia’s Outstanding Companies Poll.
Going forward, Top Glove remains upbeat about prospects for both company as well as industry, observing that the demand for gloves is still strong as demonstrated by the sales and volume growth. With the on-going quality, automation and process improvement initiatives in place, Top Glove remains optimistic of a better showing in the financial year ahead.

TOP GLOVE CORPORATION BHD's 4QFY19 net profit was below our/consensus expectations on weak sales from stiff competition in the latex segment. However, competition has subsided and we expect Top Glove to benefit temporarily from the trade war.
We reduced our FY20-21F EPS by 11-13% and introduce FY22F. Our Target Price is also reduced to MYR4.30 (-11%), pegging to an unchanged CY20F P/E of 26x (10% discount to our target P/E for Hartalega).
Our preferred pick is Kossan (BUY, Target Price MYR5.10) for its exposure in the non-medical segment and undemanding CY20F P/E of 22x.
Results Below Our/consensus Expectations
Top Glove's 4QFY8/19 net profit of MYR80m (+7% q-o-q, -21% y-o-y), brought FY19 net profit to MYR371m (-15% y-o-y) and made up 93%/90% of our/street’s full-year estimates.
The company also declared a final DPS of 4sen, bringing full-year DPS to 7.5sen (-12% y-o-y), representing 51% of FY19 net profit. See Top Glove's dividend history.
Affected by Stiff Competition in Latex Segment
Despite a higher overall ASP (+5% q-o-q), revenue was flattish q-o-q on weaker sales volume (-5% q-o-q). There was volume weakness in the latex segment (-12 to 23% q-o-q), potentially due to competition from Sri Trang (SGX:NC2).
Nitrile volume was stronger (+12% q-o-q), potentially due to a faster demand for its nitrile non-medical gloves, a result of the structural demand shift from plastic vinyl. Its plastic glove recorded weaker revenue (-17% q-o-q, -54% y-o-y) and wider EBIT loss of MYR4m (3QFY19: MYR2m);
Aspion sank into a pretax loss of MYR4m (3QFY19: MYR4m PBT) as the operation of the sterile vendor was affected.
Temporary Boost From US-China Trade War
Earnings may improve in 1QFY20 on strong demand for its nitrile glove following US 15% tariff on China’s rubber examination gloves. Also, we understand that the latex gloves sales have also improved slightly, potentially due to better global demand.
Nevertheless, we reduce our FY20-21F EPS by 11%/13% as we trim our ASP assumption for latex glove by 3% p.a. as we think stiff competition may recur given Sri Trang’s ambition of becoming world’s top 3 glove producer (5th largest now).

Top Glove reported a net profit of RM80.1m in 4QFY19,
up 7.2%% qoq but down 13.3% yoy. Meanwhile, quarterly revenue stood at RM1189.6m, -0.1% qoq and -2.8% yoy.
For 12MFY19, the group attained a higher topline (+13.8% yoy), but lower bottomline (-12.7% yoy).
Below expectations. Overall, 12MFY19 net profit accounts for 92%/91.4% of our/consensus full year estimates. The lower-than-expected earnings were mainly due to the spike in raw material prices (i.e. 22% surge in natural rubber prices).
Comment
Better qoq earnings driven by lower tax expense. As compared to 3QFY19, the Group recorded flattish revenue (- 0.1% qoq) due to lower contribution from vinyl glove and natural rubber glove segment which offset higher contribution from nitrile glove segment. Also, a slightly lower PBT was recorded, -1.2% qoq, as dragged by higher latex prices as upward revision in selling prices since 3QFY19 still not sufficient to uplift the profit during this quarter. However, lower effective tax rate in 4QFY19 helped to lift the overall profit.
Lower yoy earnings dragged by higher latex price. The Group recorded a lower revenue, -2.8%, dented by lower sales volume (-2%). Also, PBT/PBT margin dropped by - 41.0%/4.4ppts, with the impact of hike in natural latex price.
Unfavourable 12MFY19 performance. The Group achieved a stronger sales revenue growth (+13.8% yoy) thanks to higher sales volume growth from nitrile glove (+30% yoy) and surgical glove (+46% yoy) segment, which offset lower sales volume growth from vinyl glove (-29%) segment. Again, lower PBT was recorded (-16.9% yoy) no thanks to higher operating expenses, bogged down by sharp spike of latex price (+22%).
Dividend declared. The Group declared a final dividend of 4 sen/share. Total dividend for FY19 amounted to 7.5 sen/share, which translates into a dividend yield of 1.6% based on the current share price.
Continuous expansion to improve productivity. The Group will continue its expansion of existing facilities and the construction of new facilities, which will boost the total production line (+194 lines) and production capacity (+20.2b) by end of 2020. As such, the Group is projected to have 876 production lines along with a production capacity of 84.1b per annum.
Oversupply in Vinyl glove segment. Year to date, Vinyl gloves sales volume have been decreased by 29% as a result
of increased competition in the vinyl glove segment in China. Looking forward, we expect a lower contribution from Vinyl glove segment. However, we do not expect significant impact, as it accounts for less than 8% of the Group total revenue.
Unstable raw material prices. Looking forward, the Group expects a higher selling price for natural rubber glove after upward revision to its average selling price. However, we believe that the Group is still unable to fully offset the cost hike in 1QFY20. Yet, we foresee a slightly better operating margin in 1QFY20F as compared to 4QFY19.
Risks include: 1) USD falls sharply against MYR, 2) heightened competition (i.e. nitrile segment), 3) potential overcapacity in the industry and 4) rising cost of material.
Earnings Outlook/Revision
We revise downward our FY20F earnings forecasts by - 9.8% to RM396.1m as a result of lower-than-expected operating margin due to higher raw material prices (i.e. natural rubber price). We also introduce our FY21F net earnings of RM434.0m. Our net profits for FY20F and FY21F represent growths of 6.9% and 9.6% respectively.
Valuation & Recommendation
Maintain HOLD with a lower target price of RM4.67 (previous target price of RM4.90) after our earnings downgrade. Our revised target price is now pegged at 30.1x FY20F PER (from 27.5x), which is at its 3-year historical mean PE.

4QFY19 earnings came in at RM80.1m (+7.2%qoq) in view of higher sales volume of nitrile gloves
However, lower contribution from the natural rubber gloves partially subdued the earnings growth
All in, FY19 earnings performance lagged ours and consensus estimates
Final dividend declared of 4.0sen per share, leading to cumulative FY19 dividend of 7.5sen
Maintain NEUTRAL with a revised TP of RM4.58
Lagged estimates. Top Glove’s 4QFY19 earnings came in at RM80.1m. This translates into a sequential earnings expansion of +7.2%qoq. Cumulatively, this bring its full year FY19 earnings to RM370.6m, which lagged our and consensus full-year FY19 earnings estimates at 89.3% and 90.8% respectively. This was mainly due to the lower than expected sales volume for natural rubber gloves.
Declined in sales volume of natural rubber gloves. The sales volume for natural rubber gloves declined sequentially in the quarter under review. This is in contrast to the previous quarter where sales volume rose by +9.2%qoq. Fortunately, the decline was mitigated by higher sales volume of nitrile glove resulting in a marginal decline in quarterly revenue by -0.1%qoq. Note that despite nitrile glove historical contribution of about 45.0% to total revenue, the higher sales volume failed to lift overall revenue due to the subdued selling price. Notwithstanding that trend, 4QFY19 earnings improved on quarter-onquarter basis thanks to the relatively stable nitrile latex prices (slight increase of +1.0%qoq).
Prospect. Prospects for the rubber glove manufacturing sector remain strong with increasing demand arising from switching trends towards nitrile glove. In response to this, Top Glove is expected to add more than 14.2b pieces of nitrile glove production capacity per annum by the end of CY20. Post completion of the expansion plan, the group will become the largest manufacturer of nitrile glove with total production capacity of more than 30.0b pieces per annum (out of its total capacity per annum of 84.1b). Nonetheless, we view that the aggressive expansion in production capacity will lead to downward pricing pressure.
Final dividend declared. The final dividend for FY19 of 4.0sen per share was declared. This brings the cumulative dividend to 7.5sen per share for FY19 (vs FY18 of 8.0sen per share).
Impact to earnings. We revised our FY20F downwards by -2.7%yoy as we take into account the slower sales volume for natural rubber glove. The slower sale in natural rubber glove is expected to be partially mitigated by the lower rubber latex price which has eased by -12.0%qoq to about RM4.40/kg.
Target price. We tweaked our TP downward to RM4.58 (previously RM4.70) per share. Our valuation is premised on FY20 EPS of 18.3sen pegged to an unchanged PER of 25x which is the company’s three-year historical average PER.
Maintain NEUTRAL. We view that the group’s outlook will continue to be underpinned by stable and steady growth in demand of disposable medical glove as health regulations become more stringent. In addition, we expect finance cost to remain elevated as the expansion will be funded via borrowings. That said, we believe that the diversity of its existing product range as well as Top Glove’s position as the world’s largest glove manufacturer serves as a competitive advantage over other major glove manufacturers. Nonetheless, we believe the positivity has been priced in at current valuation. Coupled with an unattractive dividend yield of +1.9%, the upside is limited compared to its smaller peers. All factors considered, we maintain our NEUTRAL recommendation on the stock.

The company declared a final dividend of 4 sen per share, payable 23 December 2019. Despite the decline in profits, MQ Research maintains Outperform (OP) on Top Glove.
Event
Top Glove reported a poor set of 4QFY19 results with profit after tax (PAT) of RM80m (-13% y-y; +7% q-q), taking full-year FY19 net profit to RM371m (+12% q-q), 6% below MQ Research’s estimate. Following our checks with management, the miss was due to lower sales volume of latex gloves, wider losses for its vinyl plant in China (-RM3.7mn) and higher finance costs.
It declared a final dividend of 4sen, amounting to a total dividend of 7.5sen for FY19E (52% payout ratio). It will hold an analyst briefing on 4 Oct (Friday).
Impact
Operationally, 4QFY19 sales volume reported a mixed picture with nitrile glove increasing 10% q-q, while latex glove dropped 18% q-q. The reduction in latex glove volume was due to price competition from Sri Trang, the Thailand glove manufacturer and slower demand growth from emerging markets. Per MQ Research’s ASEAN conference note, management indicates Sri Trang gained market share from Top Glove in certain price sensitive markets.
Gross profit (GP) margin of latex glove recovered 2ppts to 16% in 4QFY19, driven by the average selling price (ASP) increase during March to May. GP margin of nitrile glove also increased 1-2ppts to 19% in this quarter. However, this is offset by the wider losses in the vinyl glove segment in its China factory. As such, Group earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) margins dropped 0.3ppts to 12.5%.
In terms of demand, nitrile glove segment continues seeing stronger demand with order lead time of 45-50 days, while latex glove remains sluggish with a lead time of 30 days. In light of losing market share to Sri Trang, Top Glove appears to be more aggressive going forward in the latex glove segment. MQ Research estimates every US$1 drop in latex glove ASP would lower MQ Research’s PAT forecast by 18-20%. Nonetheless, MQ Research thinks the margin impact can be mitigated by production cost savings – i) the latex raw material price continues its downtrend; ii) its ongoing cost initiatives to reduce labour cost.
Action and Recommendation
MQ Research maintains Outperform with a target price of RM5.02 based on 25x price to earnings ratio (PER).

Despite improvement in the nitrile glove segment, this was not enough to compensate for the weakness at both the natural latex and vinyl glove segments. We are lowering our EPS for FY20-21E by 8.6-12.9% to factor in our lower margin assumptions. As such, we are cutting our TP to RM4.10 and downgrading our call to SELL from HOLD.
Increased Competition in the Latex and Vinyl Glove Segments
TOPG has started to increase the average selling price (ASP) of natural latex gloves by 4-12% qoq in the 4Q FY19, to pass on the higher raw material cost. Despite the improvement in margin, overall profit was still down qoq, due to the decline in sales volume by 12-23% qoq. However, we believe that as other manufacturers start to raise ASPs, we expect TOPG’s volume to recover too. The easing in the latex price in recent months can help to ease pricing pressure. The losses for the vinyl glove segment have also widened during the quarter, due to stiffer competition in China, as the China government eases its environmental controls.
Continues to Take Market Share in the Nitrile Segment
The nitrile segment continues to be the bright spot for Top Glove, as sales volume grew by 30% yoy for FY19, despite the higher competition in the segment. The rise in sales volume was supported by the rise in capacity by 6% qoq. TOPG also increased ASPs by 1% during the quarter to pass on the higher nitrile costs. The price increase has not impacted sales, as volume grew by 12% qoq for 4Q FY19, which leads us to believe TOPG is winning market share from other manufacturers. Top Glove is aiming to boost its capacity to 84.1bn pieces in 2020 (from current 63.9bn pieces).
Downgrading to SELL as We Revise Down Our EPS
We are cutting our EPS for FY20-21E by 9-13% on our lower profit-margin assumptions in the natural glove segment. After our earnings cuts, we are lowering our 12-month TP to RM4.10 (from RM4.70), based on an unchanged target PER of 24x on our CY20E EPS. With 13% downside potential to our new TP, we downgrade our rating to SELL from HOLD. Upside risk: better-than-expected performance at its China operations.

The results were broadly in line with our forecast, but below consensus estimates at 90% of full year estimate. The weaker performance was due to intense competition in the latex glove segment, losses in its vinyl glove segment and also the higher-than-expected finance cost incurred. We maintain our forecast and our Underperform call, with an unchanged TP of RM4.15. Top Glove also declared a final dividend of 4sen per share, bringing full year cumulative dividend to 7.5sen per share, translating to a dividend payout of 52%.
Topline growth offset by margin compression. Top Glove’s FY19 full year revenue grew by 13.8% YoY to RM4.8bn, on the back of stronger sales (+10% YoY). The increase in sales was mainly driven by the nitrile (+30% YoY) and surgical glove (+46% YoY) segments. Despite stronger topline growth, EBITDA eased marginally by 0.9% YoY to RM694.9m while margin contracted to 14.5%, from 16.3% in 4QFY18. We attribute the weaker EBITDA to heightened competition in the latex and vinyl glove segments. On a side note, Aspion has contributed RM19m to the Group’s bottomline. The average utilization rate for Top Glove and Aspion currently stands at c.85% and 55% respectively.
Segmental information. Operations in China continued to record losses, bringing cumulative losses for FY19 to RM4.1m. The lackluster performance was a result of the ongoing oversupply condition of vinyl gloves in China. We note that Top Glove’s China counterparts are throwing down prices of vinyl gloves and the ASP currently has fallen to c.USD10 per thousand pieces, as opposed to the original level of c.USD13 per thousand pieces. Profit contribution from Thailand operations is still on a downtrend, reporting only a mere RM0.1m profit this quarter, compared to RM3.5m in 3QFY19, as it was weighed down by the competition in the latex glove segment as well as the volatility in latex prices as that Top Glove operates two latex concentration plant in Thailand.
Outlook. Top Glove’s current installed capacity stands at 63.9bn pcs pa, with 682 lines in total. F7A (+0.8bn pcs pa) and F32 2nd Phase (+1.2bn pcs pa) are expected to come on stream and start producing by 4QCY19. F7A, which is located in Thailand will be allocated to produce latex gloves, while F32 2nd Phase can produce both nitrile and latex gloves. Construction of vinyl glove plant in Vietnam is underway, which will allow Top Glove to take advantage of the lower labor and energy cost considering that factories can use coal-fired burners in Vietnam. The vinyl glove factory is expected to be ready by mid CY2020.

该公司第四季的营业额为11亿8959万4000令吉，比前期的12亿2361万2000令吉微跌2.78%。全年营业额为48亿零175万9000令吉，较前期的42亿2074万2000令吉增加13.76%。
派终期股息4仙
该公司董事部宣布派发每股4仙的终期股息，将在12月9日除权、10日享有。
顶级手套在文告中指出，虽然目前营运环境具挑战笼罩下，特别是手套产品原料成本走高，以及市场竞争激烈，但该公司的销售营收及销售量仍然取得增长。
该公司收入改善主要是丁腈手套销售量激增约30%，因公司专注加强行销力度，以及过去2年的丁腈手套产能增加54%所推动，该公司计划推动销售额进一步成长。
此外，该公司的手术手套销售量也成长46%，这主要来自Aspion的贡献。
除了销量增长，该公司改善产品素质和营运效率，特别是更新颖及技术的先进丁腈手套工厂及自动化，也是支撑业绩表现稳定的个中主因。
无论如何，受到原料天然乳胶价格剧增的影响，该公司全年税后净利下跌。
成本转嫁机制所带来的利益刚于2019财政年末季度起效，从而导致了2019财政年的成长业绩相对缓慢。此外，塑胶手套市场的亏损及利息费用的增加导致2019财政年利润下滑。
另外，该公司于新兴市场的需求量持续稳定增长，但需求量的增长幅度与自多年来表现最强劲的2018财政年相比仍显缓慢。
该公司指出，2019财政年业绩比前期来得低，主要是2018财政年是个特殊财政年，即取得破纪录业绩表现，而该公司认为这不是能每年都可达致的表现。
坚信未来创下更高业绩
顶级手套集团执行主席丹斯里林伟才表示：“公司在充满挑战和竞争的环境下取得成长，达到高达48亿令吉销售额。凭着集团不懈的努力、更精明及更有效率地付出，我们坚信有能力在未来的季度创下更高的业绩。”
他指出，为了应对预计每年10%增长的全球手套需求量，该公司并不担忧供过于求的现象，而是持续专注于内部有机扩张。
展望未来，林伟才表示：“手套的销售额及销售量处于增长阶段，由此可见，手套的需求量依然强劲。凭着集团持续改进品质、自动化及制造流程等条件，我们对未来的财务年保持乐观。”

Top Glove reported FY19 net profit of RM370.6mn (-12.7% YoY). Excluding forex losses of RM11.8mn, FY19 core net profit of RM382.4mn (-13.7% YoY) came in within our but below consensus estimates at 97.5% and 93.7% of full-year estimates respectively.
YoY, FY19 adjusted PBT declined by 17.6% to RM442.5mn despite higher revenue growth of 13.8% to RM4.8bn on the back of higher sales volume growth of 10%. We attribute the poor performance to: i) competition in the natural rubber glove segment, which caused margin compression, ii) time-lag in passing on the increase of natural rubber raw material cost and iii) higher finance cost. Coupled with the losses from the vinyl glove segment, FY19 adjusted PBT margin declined by 3.5p.p to 9.2%.
Besides, Aspion continued to underperform, recording profit of circa-RM19mn in FY19, which was way below the profit of RM108.3mn for 2019 guaranteed by the vendor previously.
QoQ, 4QFY19 adjusted PBT declined by 13.6% to RM83.8mn underpinned by lower sales volume, which dropped by circa-4.5% and losses from the vinyl glove segment. However, net profit increased by 7.2% to RM80.1mn mostly due to the lower tax rate of 1.3% (versus 8.6% in 3QFY19) following the recognition of deferred tax assets from unutilised tax losses and allowances.
Separately, the group announced a final dividend of 4.0sen/share. This will bring FY19’s total dividend to 7.5sen/share (FY18: 8.5sen/share), representing a payout ratio of 52%.
Impact
We adjust our FY20/FY21 earnings estimates lower by 5.3%/5.7% after lowering our ASP assumptions by 0.7% and imputing FY19 figures into our model.
Outlook
We expect sales volumes to pick up by circa-8% in 1QFY20 results as demand has normalised. Management alluded that gross margin will recover by 5-10% in FY20 as natural rubber price is on a downward trend (currently at RM4.38/kg versus RM5.11/kg in April-19).
In terms of capacity expansion, Top Glove’s total capacity is expected to increase by 31.6% to 84.1bn gloves/annum (63.9bn/gloves currently) by end-2020.
Valuation & Recommendation
Following the earnings cut, our target price for Top Glove is revised lower to RM4.41/share (previously RM4.67/share) based on an unchanged PE of 26.0x against CY20 EPS. Maintain Sell.

The negative variance from our forecast is due to lower-thanexpected margins for latex gloves due to competitive pressure. As such, we cut our FY20E net profit by 20%. Correspondingly, we also downgrade our TP from RM4.50 to RM4.00. Downgrade from MARKET PERFORM to UNDERPERFORM.
FY19 PATAMI of RM370.6m (-13% YoY) came in below expectations at 94%/90% of our/consensus full-year forecasts. The negative variance from our forecast is due to lower-than-expected margins for latex gloves due to competitive pressure. A 4.0 sen dividend per share was declared bringing FY19 DPS to 7.5 sen in line with expectation.
Key result highlights. QoQ, 4Q19 revenue came in flat (-0.1%) due to lower sales volume (-5%) but mitigated by higher ASP (+4%). PBT margin was flat at 6.8% despite higher ASP due to lower profit contribution from natural rubber glove segment due to lower sales volume in latex gloves and a small loss in the vinyl glove segment. This brings 4Q19 PATAMI to RM80.1m (+7.2%) boosted by a lower effective tax rate of 1.2% compared to 8.6% in 3Q19.
YoY, FY19 revenue rose 14% due to higher sales volume (+10%) and ASP (+0.7%). However, PBT fell 17% mainly attributed to a sharp upward movement in the 3Q19 input natural latex price (+22%) and intense competition in the latex segment leading to lower margins which adversely impacted bottom line. As a result, FY19 PATAMI was lower by 13% cushioned by a lower effective tax rate of 13.3% compared to 16.3% in FY18.
Intense competition in latex more than offset uptick in nitrile demand. Looking ahead, the keen competition in the latex segment could negatively impact latex gloves margin. Although we are positive on growth in subsequent quarters underpinned by uptick in nitrile demand driven by re-stocking activities, the group is plagued with competitive pressure from low margins latex gloves (accounts for estimated 50% of product mix) which could offset the gains in the nitrile segment. The robust demand for nitrile gloves led to longer delivery lead times to between 45 to 50 days as compared to 30 to 40 days previously.
Expansion plans. Top Glove’s capacity expansion includes: Factory 32 (Phases 2 to commence production by 4Q 2019; 1.2b pieces), Factory 2B (operational by 4Q19; 0.8b pieces), Factory 5A (operational by 1Q 2020; 2b pieces), Factory F40 (Phase 1 operational by 2Q 2020 and Phase 2 operational by 3Q 2020; 3.6b pieces), Factory F41 (operational 2Q 2020; 4b pieces PVC gloves) Factory F42 (operational by 4Q 2020; 4.8b pieces), and Factory 8A (operational by 4Q 2020 delayed from early 2020; 2.8b pieces) which will boost the group’s total production capacity by 20.2b gloves per annum to 84.1b (+32%).
Downgrade our FY20E net profit by 20% due to the lower-thanexpected pre-tax margin from 10% to 9%, no thanks to lower latex glove margin. We introduced FY21E NP into our earnings forecasts.
Downgrade from MP to UP. Correspondingly, our TP is cut from RM4.50 to RM4.00 based on unchanged 25.5x CY20E revised EPS of 15.8 sen (at +1.0SD above 5-year historical forward mean). Although we expect uptick in nitrile demand to anchor growth in subsequent quarters, the group overall profitability is plagued with competitive pressure from low margins latex gloves and a slow recovery at Aspion.
A key upside risk to our call is the better-than-expected margin.

We maintain our BUY call on Top Glove Corporation (Top Glove) with a lower FV of RM5.47/share based on a P/E of 27.7x FY20F EPS. We cut our earnings forecast for FY20F and FY21F by 14.5% and 8.7% respectively as we reduce our margins expectations due to stiff competition.
We continue to like Top Glove for its: (1) expansionary plans; (2) focus and continual efforts in improving quality and operational efficiency; and (3) position as the largest rubber glove manufacturer.
Top Glove’s FY19 net profit of RM370.6mil (-12.7% YoY) was below both our and street’s estimates. The deviation was largely due to lower-than-expected margins as the group faced tough competition.
Key highlights of Top Glove’s FY19 results include:
Top Glove’s FY19 revenue grew 13.8% YoY to RM4,801.8mil on the back of a 10% increase in sales volume and a 1% rise in ASP.
The group’s capacity has expanded by 5.6% to circa 63.9bil pieces in FY19 and capacity utilization remained close to 90%. This was driven by strong demand from the developed markets.
We believe that Top Glove’s business in the USA will benefit from the US-China trade war (the USA made up circa 27% of sales volume). However, this would be slightly offset by increased competition in other markets.
The group’s EBITDA grew by 1.0% to RM706.8mil in FY19. However, EBITDA margin dropped 1.9ppt to 14.7%. This was attributed to the sharp rise in the natural rubber latex price of more than 30% between February and April 2019. This resulted in a pricing mismatch between the cost of raw materials and selling price. The group also faced tough operating conditions due to the hike in labour cost and natural gas tariff.
We believe the group’s ability to pass on the cost increase was also impeded by increased competition. However, the group’s nitrile glove sales mix which increased to 42% (36% in FY18) slightly mitigated the drop in margin as Top Glove’s nitrile gloves command a slightly higher margin compared with latex gloves.
The group attributed the softer performance in FY19 to increased competition in the natural rubber glove segment, spike in natural rubber latex prices, slower growth in demand in emerging markets and losses from the vinyl glove segment. Top Glove’s China unit recorded an operating loss of RM4.1mil in FY19 (EBIT of RM27.9mil in FY18) due to increased competition.
Moving forward, Top Glove will continue to face pressure on margins due to the influx of nitrile and latex glove supply in CY19 and CY20 of 15.0% and 22.3% respectively by the top rubber producers (Top Glove, Kossan, Hartalega) as well as from Thailand-based Sri Trang with plans to increase latex glove supply to 30bil pieces (from 21bil currently) by 2020. As this exceeds the organic demand growth expectation of 8–10%, we believe ASP will come under pressure. We have reduced our EBITDA margin estimates for FY20F and FY21F to 14.9% and 15.1% respectively.

Better q-o-q on higher contribution from the nitrile glove segment.
Declared final DPS of 4.0 sen; total yield of 1.6%.
Maintain HOLD and Target Price of RM4.50.
What’s New
Within expectations.
TOP GLOVE CORPORATION BHD registered a net profit of RM80.1m in 4QFY19 (-21.2% y-o-y; +7.2% q-o-q), bringing FY19 net profit to RM370.5m, which is within expectations.
Final dividend.
Top Glove declared a final single-tier DPS of 4 sen in 4QFY19 (vs. 5.0 sen in 4QFY18 adjusted for the bonus issue). Total dividend was 7.5 sen in FY19 (vs. 8.5 sen in FY18), translating into a yield of 1.6%. This is higher than our expectations of DPS of 5.4 sen. See Top Glove's dividend history.
Result Review
Better earnings q-o-q.
Top Glove's 4QFY19 net profit came in at RM80.1m, increasing 7.2% q-o-q. The improvement was mainly driven by higher contribution from the nitrile glove segment. Net margin improved to 7% in 4QFY19 compared to 6% in 3QFY19, thanks to upward revision in selling price for natural rubber gloves.
Weaker ASP y-o-y.
The average selling price (ASP) in USD terms is weaker y-o-y but increased q-o-q for 4QFY19. Nitrile raw material prices were weaker y-o-y at RM4.41/kg (- 14.2% y-o-y, +0.9% q-o-q), while natural rubber latex prices were higher y-o-y at RM4.65/kg (+5.2% q-o-q).
Weaker EBIT/k gloves.
EBIT/k gloves came in at RM7.58 (- 35.7% y-o-y, +3.0% q-o-q). The better EBIT/k q-o-q was mainly due to the upward revision of selling price for natural rubber gloves, with the time lag for passing through raw material cost increases in 3QFY19 normalising.
Outlook
Capacity expansion.
From its latest update in Sep 2019, the Group’s total installed capacity is 63.9bn pieces of gloves. The capacity expansion plan remains intact where Factory F32 Phase 2 is expected to commence operations in 4QCY19, while F2B’s refurbishment has been scheduled to 1QCY20.
Expansion plans for CY20 include F2B refurbishment, Factory F5A, Factory F40, Factory F42 (Phase1), Factory F41 (Vietnam), and Factory F8A (Thailand). These expansions will add capacity of 18.2bn gloves p.a. in CY20, raising Top Glove’s annual capacity to 84.1bn pieces at the end of CY20 – representing a 32% increase from the current installed capacity of 63.9bn pieces. We have incorporated management’s capacity expansion guidance for into our earnings forecasts.
Focus on digitalisation and automation to save costs.
In the middle to longer term, management intends to embark on digitalisation and automation efforts via the Industry 4.0 framework involving the application of Internet of Things (IoT), robotics and automated real-time manufacturing systems. This is to reduce the foreign labour reliance and improve the efficiency of the manufacturing process.
Valuation
Valuations at higher end.
Our Target Price of RM4.50 is based on 23x CY20 EPS, which is equivalent to +1 SD of its 5-year mean PE. We maintain our HOLD call as Top Glove is trading at 32x FY19 PE, equivalent to +2.5 SD of its 5-year mean PE or +2.0 SD of its 10-year mean. (Using the latest FX rate of RM1 to 0.3296SGD, we derive target price of 1.483 in SGD term).
A key re-rating catalyst for Top Glove would be a faster-than-expected recovery of its subsidiary Aspion.

We maintain our end-2019 FBM KLCI target of 1,680pts
Stock market indices provider FTSE Russell has retained Malaysia on its FTSE World Government Bond Index (WGBI) watch list for potential downgrade during the just announced September 2019 review. The next review will only be due in March 2020. This is negative to the market as it means the overhanging concern on potential US$8bil (RM33.6bil) foreign outflows from the Malaysian bond market in the event of a downgrade will not immediately go away. Apart from Malaysian bonds, a downgrade would hurt the ringgit, and in turn, the appetite for Malaysian equities as well.
Nonetheless, we are maintaining our end-2019 FBM KLCI target at 1,680pts based on 17x our 2020F earnings projection (+7.6%), which is at a discount to its 5-year historical average of about 18x. We believe the risk-off trade will prevail over the rest of 2019. Investors are likely to continue to lighten their positions in high-risk asset classes, i.e. equities and emerging market (EM) assets, while seeking refuge in safe-haven asset classes, i.e. developed market (DM) bonds and even zeroyielding precious metals.
Typically, an easing cycle in the US shall usher in a new capital inflow cycle to EMs, including Malaysia, as investors step up the hunt for yield. This was the case in June and July 2019 when EM bond funds and Malaysian Government Securities (MGS) both attracted substantial net inflows (Exhibits 1 & 3). We were hopeful then that the inflows would eventually spill over to equities but this did not materialise (Exhibits 2 & 4).
As it stands now, the tailwind of accommodative monetary policy by key central banks in the world has been negated by the headwinds of the heightened US-China trade tensions and a mounting global recession risk, as illustrated in the flattened, and at times, inverted US bond yield curve.
Our Top Buys
Amidst the heightened US-China trade tensions and a mounting global recession risk, we anchor our stock selection on:
1. Value stocks – Malayan Banking (discount to historical P/B ratio, dividend yield of 6–7% p.a.), RHB Bank (0.8–0.9x P/B ratio) and Serba Dinamik (steep discount P/E valuation to peer Dialog Group);
2. Defensive plays in a low interest rate environment – Tenaga Nasional (also potential rerating via a demerger exercise);
3. Beneficiaries of the US-China trade war/trade diversion – Top Glove (tariff advantage over Chinese exporters in the US market), Westports and MMC Corp (trade diversion from the US-China trade war, as reflected in the increased throughput recently); and
4. Domestic consumption proxies – DRB-Hicom (also Proton’s turnaround), MBM Resources (also Perodua’s dominance in the local auto sector) and Berjaya Food (consumer lifestyle and experience) (Exhibit 5).

The FBM KLCI gained ground yesterday, albeit with minor upsides to break its downward spell on mild bargain hunting activities ahead of the announcement on Malaysia government bond’s position in the World Bond Index and the overnight gains on Wall Street. The lower liners also made mild headway, along with the most of the broader market shares.
Still, fresh buying was selective as gainers were only marginally ahead of losers on a ratio of 398-to-370 stocks. The gains were also on low participation as traded volumes slipped 17.4% to just 1.81 bln shares amid the continuing wariness over the market’s direction.
Among the FBM KLCI components, Hong Leong Financial Group rose 26.0 sen, followed by Petronas Gas (+16.0 sen), KL-Kepong (+18.0 sen) and Maybank (+8.0 sen). On the broader market, consumer bellwethers like Carlsberg (+50.0 sen), and Dutch Lady (+40.0 sen) gained. Scientex rose 26.0 sen after reporting strong quarterly earnings, while Degem rose 22.0 sen after its major shareholders announced plans to take the company private.
Among the top losers were BAT (-22.0 sen), plantation giants like United Plantations (-16.0 sen) and Genting Plantations (-13.0 sen), followed by Lafarge Malaysia (-12.0 sen) and Pentamaster (-11.0 sen). On the big board, Maxis (-19.0 sen), Petronas Dagangan (-12.0 sen) and Malaysia Airports (-6.0 sen) were the main losers for the day.
Asian stocks were generally positive with Japanese stocks rising slightly after the U.S and Japan agreeing to an initial trade deal that would delay tariffs on Japanese automobiles. The Nikkei rose 0.1%, but China stocks lost ground on still uncertain outcome of its trade negotiations with the U.S. The Hang Seng, however, edged higher by 0.4%. Meanwhile, ASEAN equities were broadly higher at the close, save for the STI that closed unchanged.
The Dow lost ground overnight, shedding 0.3% as markets shift their attention to impeachment highlights against U.S. President Donald Trump. The S&P 500 also ended lower (-0.2%), while the Nasdaq lost 0.1%.
European equities, however, rose with the FTSE (+0.8%) registering the strongest gains on gains in selected stocks to offset the profit warnings from several blue chips. The CAC (-0.7%) and DAX (- 0.7%) also trended higher.
THE DAY AHEAD
With stocks making headway yesterday, as anticipated, the meek spell could have been cast aside for now and we see further near-term gains that could allow the key index to end the week on a positive note.
Although Malaysian government bonds remains on the FTSE Russel watch list, the decision could provide some reprieve over the near term to accord the government some space to add liquidity to the bonds. With the exclusion risk abating for now, we also see the positivity extending to Malaysian equities over the near term and to cast aside the slight weakness on Wall Street overnight.
Therefore, we expect the gains to be augmented with the key index potentially re-challenging the 1,610 level, albeit we think that the 1,620 level remains a distant target for now. Meanwhile, the 1,600 points level is the immediate support, followed by the 1,590 level.
The lower liners and broader market shares also made headway yesterday and we think the gains could extend with bouts of buying interest emerging. The improved buying is also set to help the FBM Small Cap, FBM Fledgling and FBM ACE indices end the week on a more positive note.
COMPANY UPDATE
V.S. Industry Bhd’s (VSI) 4QFY19 net profit grew 15.2% Y.o.Y to RM48.4 mln, compared to RM42.0 mln a year ago, lifted by higher domestic sales orders coupled with increased productivity, lower initial setup costs and better product mix. Revenue, however, only gained slightly to RM1.03 bln (+1.9% Y.o.Y), from RM1.01 bln in the same quarter last year.
Full year net profit came in at RM157.5 mln (+4.3% Y.o.Y), from RM151.1 mln in the previous corresponding period as weaker contributions from overseas operations shadowed the improved domestic earnings. On that note, revenue from China was almost halved in FY19, while pre- losses almost quadrupled to RM83.0 mln, from RM20.9 mln earlier – led by prolonged underutilisation and additional costs (i.e.: impairment of fixed assets) arising from its exacerbated downsizing activities. The group has announced a fourth interim dividend of 0.8 sen and a final dividend of 0.8 sen per share, payable on 31st October 2019.
Comments
The latest results were above expectations as net profit came in about 15.9% more than our forecast of RM135.9 mln, mainly due to significantly higherthan-expected non-controlling interests estimates. Other than that, interest costs were also lower than initially accounted for. Revenue, however, were in-line with our forecast at RM3.88 bln (or 102.6% our full-year estimates).
After the unexpectedly positive performance, we upped our FY20 earnings slightly by 2.6% Y.o.Y to RM165.9 mln, while revenue forecasts were more or less maintained. The improved earnings were mainly due to higher margins amid better floor utilisation and increased cost efficiency. We also introduced our FY21 forecast net profit and revenue of RM189.8 mln and RM4.35 bln respectively.
With that, we upgrade our call on VSI to a BUY (from Hold) with a higher target price of RM1.50 (from RM1.25) as we still foresee a positive growth trend in VSI’s earnings, backed by higher orders from a notable household cleaning brand and improved efficiency. Our target price is derived by ascribing to a higher target PER of 17.0x to its FY20 EPS of 9.0 sen, due to improved sentiment in the EMS industry as local players benefit from trade diversion activities.
The target PER remains at a premium to its closest competitor, SKP Resources Bhd, after taking account the group’s leading position in Malaysia’s EMS industry that is strengthened by its wide array of supply chain services and solid earnings track-record.

The result was within our expectations but slightly below consensus. Declared final dividend of 4 sen per share (FY19 : 7.5 sen per share vs. FY18 : 8.5 sen per share). FY19 revenue grew to RM4.8bn (+13.9%) YoY due to higher sales volumes (+10%; mainly +46% surgical glove, +30% nitrile glove); however core PATAMI fell (-14.5%) due to time lag of cost-pass through mechanism and increased cost of depreciation (+34%) and higher interest expense (+125%). We keep our forecasts; maintain our BUY call with unchanged TP of RM5.31.
Within expectations. 4QFY19 revenue of RM1,189.6m (-0.1% QoQ, -2.2% YoY) with core PATAMI of RM81.4m (+0.6% QoQ, -2.1% YoY) brought full year FY19 core PATAMI to RM382.4m (-14.6% YoY). The result came within our expectations but slightly below consensus, at 96% and 93% respectively.
Dividend. Declared a final interim dividend of 4 sen p/share going on ex on the 9th December 2019, Bringing FY19 Dividend to 7.5 Sen P/share (FY18: 8.5 Sen P/share).
QoQ. Revenue fell slightly (-0.1%) mainly due to a decline in overall sales volume (- 5%). Volume for natural rubber (-18%) and vinyl (-10%) segment fell, however this was partly mitigated by an increase contribution of nitrile glove segment (+12%). Core PATAMI improved by 0.6% to RM81.4m due to lower net tax expense (-84%) on the back of recognition of deferred tax income from unutilised tax losses and allowances.
YoY. Revenue fell to RM1,189.6m (-2.2%) in tandem with volume decline (-2.0%). EBITDA margin declined by 3.6 ppts YoY to 11.8% due to losses in vinyl segment due to competition and higher interest cost (+13%) YoY. Subsequently, PBT declined (- 42.8%) to RM81.2m. However, core PATAMI grew 7.2%, due to lower tax expense of RM1.1m in 4QFY19 vs RM40.0m in 4QFY18.
FY19. Revenue of RM4,801.8m showed improvement of 13.9% on the back of improved sales volume (+10%). The positive sales volume growth mainly resulted from surgical glove (+46%) and nitrile glove segment (+30%). However this was partially offset by decline in vinyl gloves segment (-29%). EBITDA margin declined by 1.8ppts due to increase in competition in natural rubber segment coupled with the spike in natural rubber latex prices (time lag of cost-pass through mechanism; start to kick in 4QFY19). Following that, depreciation increased (+34%) due to additional expansion, and higher interest expense (+125%) was mainly due to acquisition of Aspion back in FY18 (FY18: 5 months impact, FY19: 12 months). However this was partially cushioned by lower effective tax due to recognition of deferred tax income. Hence all in, core PATAMI fell to RM382.4m (-14.5%), with a marginally lower effective tax rate (FY19: 13% vs. FY18: 16%).
Outlook. Top Glove remains in expansion mode, albeit at a more moderate pace to mitigate impact on ASP. Efforts remain on widening of different segments of gloves (latex/nitrile/bio-degradable examination gloves). Top Glove is strengthening their focus on the nitrile glove segment; and has increased its nitrile capacity by 54% over the past 2 years, with plans to grow further.
Forecast. Unchanged pending analyst briefing next week as the results were in line.
Maintain BUY, TP: RM5.31. We maintain our BUY call and unchanged TP of RM5.31. Our TP is based on FY20 earnings pegged to a PE multiple to 26x. We like Top Glove for its diverse product mix and its prime position to chip away market share.

Despite its more diversified glove portfolio, TOP GLOVE CORPORATION BHD was similarly affected by stiff competition in 1HCY19. Although we expect earnings to improve with a pick-up in demand for its nitrile medical gloves, our earnings forecasts already impute a strong earnings recovery.
Maintain HOLD and Target Price of MYR4.85, at 26x CY20E P/E or a 10% discount to our target for Hartalega in view of its lower margins/ROEs.
Prefer Kossan in the sector (BUY, Target Price MYR5.10) for its exposure in the non-medical segment and undemanding valuation.
Affected by Competition in 1HCY19
We estimate that rubber medical gloves account for 85% of its sales volume. They are followed by plastic gloves, at 9%. Plastic gloves are facing a structural decline while rubber non-medical-glove sales, at 6% of its sales volume, are rising.
Though non-medical gloves cushioned its earnings from weakness in other segments in 1HCY19, we believe a spike in latex costs affected its earnings.
Strong Demand for Its Nitrile Medical Gloves
Reflecting a pick-up in global glove purchases, the sales lead time for its nitrile medical gloves has risen to 50-60 days from 30-45. We believe global demand has picked up after purchasers’ minimal purchases in 1HCY19 amid trade-war uncertainties. Now that the US has implemented import tariffs on all of China’s gloves (except surgical gloves), we think importers are more certain of their total purchase costs.
Better Q-o-q But Weaker Y-o-y 4Q
4QFY8/19 results are scheduled for release on 26 Sep. We expect net profit to be better q-o-q but weaker y-o-y (3QFY19: MYR75m, 4QFY18: MYR102m). We think there could be volume growth, driven by new capacity from F32 (Phase1) and F33, which will raise its total capacity by 6% upon full commencement.
Margins may also improve q-o-q from higher latex glove ASPs and lower latex costs.

  （档案图：法新社）
  （吉隆坡18日讯）沙地石油设施将于9月底完全恢复产能，比市场预期来得早，隔夜（17日）国际原油价格应声大跌，大马股市油气股首当其冲，回吐昨日部份涨幅，拖累马股黯然走低，综指再度跌破1600点关口，成败皆因沙地而定。
随着沙地能源大臣萨勒曼日前表示，沙地石油设施遭无人机袭击而减少的石油产能将在本月底完全恢复，促使隔夜国际油价应声而跌，特别是给投机油气股或卖空原油期货的投机客，沉重一击。
马股综指今早开市即跌破1600点，油气股领跌及卖压涌现，使综指一度挫跌10.21点或0.63%至1594.09点最低，全天收市时报1599.49点，下跌4.81点。
分析员认为，这都是油气股回落所累，市场以为原油价格会企高一段时期甚至是数个月，岂料事与愿违，萨勒曼声明打碎市场对油气股的憧憬，令油气股打回原形。
较能反映大市走势的全股项指数全天落22.22点或0.2%至11299.47点。创业板指数跌1.94点至4531.03点，全场成交量为19亿8100万股，值16亿零200万令吉。上升股有339只、下跌股480只，另有416只平盘。
全球油气股回吐涨幅
昨日收盘时，美国纽约商品交易所的10月交货轻质原油期货价格重挫3.56美元，于每桶59.34美元挂收，跌幅达5.66%，使全球油气股回落，几乎完全回吐昨日升幅。11月交货的伦敦布兰特原油期货则下跌4.47美元，跌幅达6.48%至每桶64.55美元。
丰隆研究认为，短期内油气股提供短线交易机会，惟中东地缘政治恶化却是不争的事实，尚难料进一步发展，特是沙地及盟友美国料将采取加强国安行动、甚至回击侵袭者，美国总统暗示可能采取军事行动反击，使短期市场走势受干扰，潜在风险不得小觑。
该行指出，过去6年纪录显示，马股综指与国际布兰特原油价格走势关连度高达67%，所以两者之间走势可说是相当一致，或一起浮沉的几率偏高。
马银行研究表示，若国际原油价格回扬，预料油气股业领域的整个价值链将受惠，惟沙地油气设施遭袭事件，牵引油价走势动荡，特别使全球油气业的资本开销及预算将更为复杂。
油气股跌多起少
较早时市场预期沙地减少约占全球5%原油产能，预计需要长达数个月才能恢复，随着萨勒曼最新宣布，使油气股今早开市后马上回落，交投炽热的沙布拉能源（SAPNRG,5218,主板能源组）全天下跌0.5仙至29仙，阿玛达（ARMADA,5210,主板能源组）则平盘报31.5仙。
科恩马集团（KNM,7164,主板能源组）则因宣布取得5327万令吉的泰国合约利好支持而逆流而上，持续昨日升势，全天起1.5仙，收在39.5仙，共有8177万3800股易手，为全场第三热门股。
国家石油旗下股项稍微回落，包括国油化学（PCHEM,5183,主板工业产品服务组）、国际船务（MISC,3816,主板交通物流组）、国油气体（PETGAS,6033,主板公用事业组）、国油气体（PETGAS,6033,主板公用事业组）及国油贸易（PETDAG,5681,主板消费产品服务组），交投谨慎。
大红花石油（HIBI S C S，5199,主板能源组）、REACH能源（REACH,5256,主板能源组）、世霸动力（SERBADK,5279,主板能源组）则走势较稳，全天股价起落不大。
手套家具股沦输家
油气股将从沙地石油设施遭袭而受益最多，马银行研究推荐沙布拉能源、大红花石油（HIBISCS,5199,主板能源组）、戴乐集团（DIALOG,7277,主板能源组）及海事重工（MHB,5186,主板能源组）。
惟该行首选是基本因素较好的云升控股（YINSON,7293,主板能源组）及VELESTO能源（VELESTO,5243,主板能源组）。市场人士相信主要是它们的基本因素及抗跌性强，较能承受油价波动冲击。
马银行研究表示，随着爆发无人机侵袭事件，相信全球更多油气商将考虑分散风险，而把储存石油分散至其他安全地点，包括戴乐集团旗下边佳兰储油设施将更受欢迎。
同时，油气上游业者如大红花石油及沙布拉能源将从高油价得益，预期旗下采油业务有望更为活跃，以及生产石油攫取更高回酬。海事重工与沙地石油签有长期岸外合约，使它有机会攫取更多工程合约。
丰隆研究指出，一旦国际石油价格走高，飞机燃料“水涨船高”，使航空业者沦为最大输家。亚航集团（AIRASIA,5099,主板消费产品服务组）为其2019年第四季85%飞机燃料进行护盘对冲、2020年则占73%，预料有助缓和高油价对盈利表现带来的负面冲击。
丰隆研究表示，高油价将推高手套主要原料丁二烯及丁腈的价格，从而使一些胶手套股项成为输家，特别是贺特佳（HARTA,5168,主板医疗保健组），因它的丁腈手套占产品混合的95%、高产柅品（KOSSAN,7153,主板医疗保健组）的丁腈手套产品占77%至78%、以及顶级手套（TOPGLOV,7113,主板医疗保健组）则占约50%水平。
同时，高油价也导至黏胶剂价格走高，黏胶剂占木基家具生产成本约15%，刨花板产品则占约60%成本，使这类家具业者如利兴工业（LIIHEN,7089,主板消费产品服务组）和家丽资机构（HOMERIZ,5160,主板消费产品服务组）也深受其害。刨花板业者包括长青纤维板（EVERGRN,5101,主板工业产品服务组）及亿维雅（HEVEA,5095,主板工业产品服务组）的打击更深。

We expect 2019 oil price to average USD68/barrel (YTD avg: USD65/barrel), implying an average of USD77/barrel in 4Q19. While higher oil price is positive for Malaysia’s government oil revenues, the 2019 average will still likely fall short of MoF’s assumption at USD72/barrel. There could also be a higher fuel subsidy bill if RON95 pump prices are kept at RM2.08/litre. Sector winners are those in the O&G upstream while losers are aviation (higher jet fuel price), gloves (higher butadiene price) and wood based manufacturers (higher glue price).
NEWSBREAK
Drone strike on Saudi oil facilities. Over the weekend (Sat), drones attacked Saudi Arabia’s oil processing facilities at Abqaiq and Khurais. The attacks have caused Saudi Aramco to shut down the struck facilities, cutting the kingdom’s oil production by 5.7mbpd (-50%), which represents c.5% of daily global production. Although unconfirmed, Saudi is said to have restored close to 70% of the disrupted output.
Geopolitical tensions escalate. Yemen’s Houthi rebels, who have been at war with a Saudi-UAE led coalition, have claimed responsibility for the attack. However, US (a Saudi ally) have accused Iran, with President Trump hinting at possible military action.
HLIB’s VIEW
Limited spare capacity. According to Bloomberg, OPEC, US and Russia have a combined estimated spare capacity of up to 3.9mbpd, although the bulk of this is from Saudi Arabia (1.7mbpd) which remains largely incapacitated at this juncture. Much of the spare capacity in the US is limited by its lagging export infrastructure (terminals and pipelines are at maximum capacity and new infra won’t kick in until 2022 at earliest). The only 2 other countries with spare capacity are Iran (1.6mbpd) and Venezuela (>0.5mbpd) although it remains highly unlikely that the USA will remove sanctions on their oil anytime soon.
Reserves on hand. Based on EIA data, OECD countries have c.2.9bn barrels of oil in reserves (commercial) ex. strategic reserves, which translates to c.60 days of supply. The US has a strategic petroleum reserve (SPR) of c.645m barrels (as at June 2019), which President Trump has indicated that the US is willing to release to combat the supply shock risk. The Saudi’s have c.188m barrels in storage and can sustain over 30 days of supply to global markets.
Upside support to oil price. Information on the supply resumption remains unclear as we await further information on the extent of the damage done to those facilities. If the outage is longer than the initial guidance of a few weeks, we can expect oil prices to rally further as reserves run down and a supply shock manifests. Coupled with escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, we believe that this will provide a near term upside support to oil price. Oil price (Brent) has averaged USD65/barrel YTD and we are keeping our full year 2019 average assumption at USD68/barrel; this implies oil price to average USD77/barrel in 4Q19.
Impact on Malaysia. Assuming oil price averages USD68/barrel for 2019 (our assumption as elaborated previously) vs current YTD average level of USD65/barrel, we estimate the additional fiscal revenue to be RM900m. However at USD68/barrel, this is still below MoF’s average assumption of USD72/barrel for 2019, indicating a possible budget shortfall of RM1.2bn. In addition, assuming the Government maintains fuel price of RON95 at RM2.08/litre, our back-of-envelop calculations suggest an additional RM1.8bn subsidy bill in 4Q19. Taken together, if oil price averages USD68/barrel in 2019 and RON95 is kept at RM2.08/litre, the budget shortfall for 2019 could be RM3bn (i.e. RM1.2bn + RM1.8bn). Nevertheless, we still think it is possible for the 2019 budget deficit target of -3.4% to be achieved as other additional Government revenue measures (e.g. voluntary tax disclosure, increased SST revenue) is estimated to give an additional RM3.6-4.9bn buffer.
KLCI correlation to oil price. In the past 6-years, there has been a modest 67% correlation between Brent oil prices and the KLCI. However more interestingly, the shorter term correlation (i.e. 60 days) between the 2 variables tends to be higher during periods of oil price decline (Figure #4). Simplistically, there is a higher tendency to observe market (i.e. KLCI) weakness during periods of oil price decline than there is market strength during an oil price rise.
Winners... Within the O&G space, those that are exposed upstream such as Reach (HOLD TP: RM0.18), Hibiscus (not-rated) and Sapura Energy (BUY, TP: RM0.35) are key winners from higher oil price. PCHEM (HOLD, TP: RM7.71) is also a beneficiary from higher oil prices (from possibly higher petrochemical prices) given its integrated cheap gas feedstock model from Petronas. For MISC (HOLD, TP: RM6.99), we reckon the impact to be neutral as weaker demand for VLCC tankers from the Middle East could be potentially offset by higher spot charters for their export lightering segment as shale producers are expected to ramp up production and exports.
…and losers. The aviation sector is a loser with higher oil price and consequently, higher jet fuel price. We understand that AirAsia (HOLD, TP: RM1.86) has hedged 85% of its jet fuel requirements for 4Q19 and 73% for 2020. Higher oil price would also result to higher butadiene price and increase nitrile prices, impacting nitrile glove makers; Hartalega (HOLD, TP: RM4.78) has 95% of its product mix in nitrile gloves, Kossan (HOLD, TP: RM4.35) at 77-78% and Top Glove (BUY, TP: RM5.31) at 50%. Lastly, glue prices may increase with higher oil price, impacting wood based manufacturers. For furniture players (Lii Hen (BUY, TP: RM4.22) and Homeritz (BUY, TP: RM0.71)), glue makes up c.15% of raw material cost while for the particleboard players (Heveaboard (SELL, TP: RM0.40) and Evergreen (SELL, TP: RM0.22)), it is higher at c.60%.

SUPERMX: Share prices were able to form a base above the support trendline after hitting YTD low of RM1.40 on 26 Mar. Trend and momentum indicators are flashing positive signals. Hence, we believe that SUPERMX is poised for an impending SMA200 breakout near RM1.61. Next target will be located at RM1.72 (50% FR) and RM1.80 (61.8% FR) before reaching our LT objective at RM1.90 (76.4% FR). Support will be located around RM1.54 (SMA30), followed RM1.50. Cut loss at RM1.46
TOPGLOVE: Following the flag formation, share prices have been trending higher in the last two weeks. Indicators are still showing positive momentum to drive prices higher to RM4.82 (higher BB) and RM4.93 (SMA200) territory. A strong breakout above RM4.93 will spur prices to our LT objective at RM5.21 (20 Feb high). Supports are situated at RM4.66 (SMA50), followed by RM4.60 (SMA30). Cut loss at RM4.55.

Improved 4QFY19 expected on better ASP and stable raw material price.
Top Glove is trading at rich valuation of +2.5 SD of 5-year mean PE or +2.0 SD of 10-year mean PE.
Maintain HOLD with lower Target Price of RM4.50.
Strong Earnings Growth Priced in
In spite of the 6% cut in our earnings, we still forecast strong earnings growth for TOP GLOVE CORPORATION BHD (SGX:BVA) at 24% and 13% y-o-y in FY20 and FY21 respectively. This will be mainly driven by an increase in sales volume on rising demand and stable operating costs.
Our target price of RM4.50 is based on 23x CY20 earnings per share (EPS), which is equivalent to +1SD of its 5-year mean price-to-earnings (PE).
We maintain our HOLD call as Top Glove is trading at a rich valuation of 31.2x FY19 PE, equivalent to +2.5x SD of its 5-year mean PE or +2.0x SD of its 10-year mean.
Where We Differ
Our earnings forecast is below consensus as we factor in more conservative average selling prices (ASPs). We expect ASP to improve in FY19 and remain flat in FY20-21.
Potential Catalysts
Top Glove could benefit from growing emerging markets that are predominantly latex users.
Another key re-rating catalyst would be the faster-than-expected recovery of its subsidiary Aspion Sdn Bhd.
What's New - Earnings Growth Driven by Sales Volume
Despite FY19-FY21 earnings reduction…
We have adjusted our FY19-21 earnings forecast downwards by 15%, 6% and 6% respectively to factor in the capacity expansion adjustment, impute the surge in raw material costs in 3QFY19 and longer gas tariff hike pass-through.
… we still expect strong earnings growth for FY20-21.
We forecast a strong earnings growth for Top Glove at 24% and 13% y-o-y in FY20 and FY21 respectively after the cut in our earnings. This will be driven by;
increased sales volume on rising market demand (compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10% in 2018-2021),
stable raw material price,
improved operational efficiency through digitalisation.
The mismatch of latex material price and latex gloves’ ASP is expected to normalise in 4QFY19, which will improve earnings in upcoming quarters.
Slight delay in capacity expansion.
In June 2019, Top Glove forecast an additional capacity of 5.4b pieces of gloves p.a. from 2QCY19 onwards, with 3.4bn pieces in 2QCY19 (Factory F32 Phase 1 and F33 new block), 1.2bn pieces in 3QCY19 (Factory F32 Phase2) and 0.8bn pieces in 4QCY19 (F2B refurbishment). However, in its latest update in Aug 2019, it has installed capacity of 3.4bn pieces and part of its capacity expansion has been delayed slightly. Factory F32 Phase 2 is expected to commence operations in 4QCY19, while F2B refurbishment has been delayed to 1QCY20.
Expansion plans for CY20 include F2B refurbishment, Factory F5A, Factory F40, Factory F42 (Phase1), Factory F41 (Vietnam), and Factory F8A (Thailand). These expansions will add capacity of 5.4bn and 18.2bn gloves p.a. for CY19 and CY20 respectively, raising Top Glove’s annual capacity to 84.1bn pieces at the end of CY20 (vs 83.3bn previously), adding 32% from current installed capacity of 63.9bn pieces. We have incorporate in the capacity expansion to our earnings forecasts as per management guidance.
Raw material prices to stabilise.
Top Glove’s revenue is mainly from latex gloves (40%) and nitrile gloves (45%). Latex material price surged 33% from Feb 2019 to May 2019, while staying range bound since May 2019 as supply picked up post winter.
On the other hand, nitrile butadiene rubber material prices were trading sideways in 1HCY19. We expect this trend to continue in 2HCY19 with stable supply and demand. Raw material prices are expected to remain range-bound in 2HCY19 owing to ample rubber supply and slow demand.
Focus on digitalisation and automation to save costs.
In the middle to long term, Top Glove is planning to embark on digitalisation and automation efforts via the Industry 4.0 framework involving the application of Internet of Things (IoT), robotics and automated real-time manufacturing systems. This is to reduce the company’s reliance on foreign labour and improve manufacturing efficiency.
4QFY19 results to improve.
The mismatch of latex material price and latex gloves’ ASP is expected to normalise in 4QFY19 on stabilising latex material price which has been range-bound since May 2019. This should lead improved earnings in the upcoming quarters despite the cut in our earnings.
To recap, Top Glove’s 3QFY19 net profit (-29.4% y-o-y; -36.5% q-o-q) was dragged by the time lag between latex material price and selling price hikes. Top Glove’s latex material price was higher in early 3QFY19, but its selling price hike only came towards the tail end of 3QFY19.
Improved ASPs expected.
Major glove manufacturers have scaled down their capacity expansion plans for 2019. New supply may ease and improve ASPs in 2HCY19 compared to 1QCY19. ASPs have trended upward since Jun 2019.
Time lag for gas tariff cost pass-through.
On 12 July, Gas Malaysia announced an increase of the average effective gas tariff to RM34.66/MMBtu (+5.3% from RM32.92/MMBtu previously) from 15 July 2019 to 31 December 2019. The gas tariff hike was significantly higher than previous revisions.
Previously, glove manufacturers managed to pass-through cost increases with price adjustments lagging by 1-3 months. The quantum of this increase was larger than the previous two gas cost increases (+0.5% for 2HCY2018; +0.7% for 1HCY2019) and may take longer to pass-through.
Valuation
We maintain our HOLD call with a lower target price of RM4.50. We reduced our Target Price to RM4.50 from RM4.80 to reflect the earnings adjustment, indicating a 4% downside from Top Glove’s current share price.
Our Target Price is based on 23x CY20 EPS, which is equivalent to +1SD of its 5-year mean PE. We maintain our HOLD call as it is trading at a rich valuation of 31.2x FY19 PE, equivalent to +2.5x SD of its 5-year mean PE or +2.0x SD of its 10-year mean. Using the FX rate of RM1 to SGD0.33, we derive target price of 1.485 in SGD term.
A key re-rating catalyst for Top Glove would be a faster-than-expected recovery of its subsdiary Aspion.

MQ Research prefers Top Glove on better earnings trajectory and cheaper valuation, per its research report dated 26 August 2019.
Conclusion
Year-to-date (YTD), the glove sector has underperformed the KLCI by 10-11%, on market concerns about Thailand’s largest glove maker, Sri Trang, expanding in Malaysia’s latex glove segment. Post MQ Research’s industry checks and analysis, it believes Sri Trang may not be a permanent threat, as Malaysian manufacturers remain more competitive in cost, pricing and in product offering that caters to current demand. The sector also has better order visibility for nitrile gloves, indicating demand recovery. This is likely to support earnings in the sector.
Impact
Is Sri Trang a threat? With Sri Trang’s aggressive expansion plan, MQ Research does not rule out price competition in latex gloves affecting Malaysia manufacturers like Top Glove and Supermax who have a higher revenue mix of latex gloves. However, MQ Research’s analysis shows Malaysia manufacturers remain competitive in terms of cost, pricing and product offering that caters to current demand dynamic. In MQ Research’s view, Sri Trang may not be a permanent threat to Malaysia manufacturers.
Better order visibility for nitrile gloves. Based on MQ Research’s industry checks, most of the Malaysian manufacturers have experienced longer order lead times for nitrile gloves since mid-2019. This is partly due to customers replenishing their inventory. With the current order lead and several expansion deferments, MQ Research views market dynamic as balanced in 2H19; however, 2020 could have a surplus of 5.6bn pcs if the scheduled expansion remains intact.
Trade diversion can mitigate the overcapacity risk in 2020. President Trump has announced that the tariff on Chinese medical and vinyl gloves – which amount to US$300bn of imports – will be raised from 10% to 15%. United States imports c.6bn pcs/annum of Chinese medical rubber gloves from China. MQ Research’s checks indicate post-tariff average selling price (ASP) of Chinese gloves will be similar or higher than that of Malaysian gloves. MQ Research thinks this new demand can be absorbed by the scheduled expansion plan and mitigate the aforementioned overcapacity risk in 2020. If there is any major shift from Chinese medical gloves to Malaysian gloves, MQ Research expects Top Glove and Hartalega to benefit, due to their large market presence in the US and to them having added the most capacity in 2H19-2020. MQ Research’s blue-sky valuation for Top Glove and Hartalega is RM6.27 and RM6.80 respectively.
Outlook
MQ Research prefers Top Glove (TOPG MK, OP, TP: RM5.02) over Hartalega (HART MK, UP, TP: RM4.05) owing to cheaper valuation and better earnings trajectory with +10% 3-yr earnings per share (EPS) compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) vs. HART’s EPS CAGR at +4%.

（吉隆坡21日讯）JP摩根表示，最近出炉的大马次季经济数据，显示有两大数据日趋正面，支持了该行对马股前景转佳的看法，并依此筛选出5大首选股项。
J P摩根在报告中说，5大首选股项为国家能源（TENAGA，5347，主板公用事业组）、兴业银行（RHBBANK，1066，主板金融服务组）、顶级手套（TOPGLOV,7113,主板医疗保健组）、戴乐集团（DIALOG,7277,主板能源组）和KLCC产托（KLCC,5235SS,主板产业投资信托组）。
建议回避国油化学 马电讯
该行建议回避的股项为国油化学（PCHEM,5183,主板工业产品服务组）及马电讯（TM,4863,主板电讯媒体组）。
该行表示，尽管经济成长率仍疲软，但依然不缺利多，包括国际收支账项中，错误与疏漏（E&O）下的资金外流情况趋稳，将对流动性正面，以及私人资本投资回扬。
保持5大交易策略
有鉴于此，该行保持5大交易策略，即1）美元走强受惠者（不包括科技股）；2）回退资本的公司（包括政府相关公司）；3）在低利率环境下受惠的领域；4）盈利将触底反弹和成长明确的公司；5）观光主题，2020年旅游年到来。
该行建议10只盈利触底回弹/成长明确的股项，部份股项提供逾5%的诱人周息率。这10只股来自不同领域，包括银行、种植、胶手套、公用事业、产业发展商、产托、基建和下游油气领域。
看好马股6大因素
JP摩根早前表示，对大马股市的看法日益正面，主要基于6大因素：1）每股盈利负成长已渐稳定下来，但需观察；2）出口短期回升；3）首季错误与疏漏转正面，不再拖累国际收支平衡（BOP）；4）资本开销初现复苏，需紧密观察；5）马中关系回温，对投资、棕油和旅游业正面；6）重启基建工程，2020年可能更正面。
下半年减速
私人消费全年料增4.3%
JP摩根认为，大马次季经济数据显示，私人消费保持韧性，共成长7.8%（优于首季的7.6%），这主要受政府补助措施带动，惟此升幅料难再现。加上外围需求放缓将冲击就业和收入，私人消费预料也随之降低。该行预测私人消费下半年减速，全年则增长4.3%。
“次季私人资本投资增长1.8%，优于首季的0.4%，但仍低于过去18年平均的7%成长。”
由于外围逆风和政策不明朗，商业资本开销放缓，私人领域资本开销保持低迷。6月采购经理指数显示萎缩至47.8。
“我们相信私人领域赚幅是私人资本投资开销的良好指标，私人领域企业赚幅若上扬，将预示私人资本投资开销将回升。”
次季FDI降80%至44亿
次季外来直接投资（FDI）从首季的217亿令吉按季降低80%至44亿令吉，按年则增长2%，上半年FDI则增68%至261亿令吉，主要是制造业投资，显示贸易战转移订单效益。若扣除IHH医保（IHH,5225,主板医疗保健组）脱售股权给外资的行动，外来直接投资共133亿令吉，按季下跌67%。
JP摩根表示，次季国际收支赤字3亿美元，经常账盈余7亿美元。
“去年错误与疏漏（E&O）外流100亿美元引忧虑，但今年已回稳，首季和次季都为流入7亿美元，这应可减缓今年后期，指数再平衡带来的资金外流压力。”
JP摩根的经济学家保持预测今年大马经济成长4.3%，预料下半年成长将较疲软。
今年成长预测普遍不变
国行11月初或再减息
其他经济学家认为，尽管大马次季经济增长4.9%比预期强劲，但基于全球经济风险升高，他们多维持今年经济增长预测，并且预期国行11月初可能再减息以扶持经济。
兴业研究经济学家卢阳康表示，由于全球贸易风险走高，维持全年经济成长4.5%预测。
联昌研究认为，大马经济增长动力较区域同侪具韧力，尽管外围此时呈波动，大马的经济强稳主要是家居收入、消费仍强劲、外来直接投资持续、农业与矿业复苏等。
联昌相信这几项因素将继续固守大马经济，护航大马全年取得4.7%增长率。
为消减经济下行风险，联昌预期政府将出台稍微扩张的财政预算案振兴经济，而国行年杪将以再减息相呼应。
兴业资深经济学家白文春指出，美中贸易紧张加剧后，看来美国已无可转圜而从9月1日起将对3000亿美元进口货品实施10%关税，另一部份则于12月15日实施。
贸易战冲击下半年显现
他说，上述于2018年7月燃起的贸易战，9月再恶化，并于2019年5月升级，这冲击我国首半年经济增长率。今年5月后贸易紧张升级的影响，会显现在下半年大马经济上。
“倘若美国对3000亿美元自中国进口商品实施关税，冲击将于2020年首半年浮现。”
除此，美国也与欧洲、日本，在汽车贸易课题上杠上，谈判料展延至2020年初。
倘若无法达致贸易协议，势将冲击全球经济增长。
美国也对进口自法国的商品实施关税，法国较早对脸书和谷歌实施3%数码税，这潜在形成新的贸易紧张局面。
国行对明年增长预估谨慎
因此白文春认为2020年国际货币组织所预测的全球增长3.5%，将衍生上述风险；该组织预测2019年全年经济增长3.2%。
他说，基于外围变数大，然而国行认为不致形成全球经济衰退；目前国行对2020年经济增长预估表现谨慎，财政部长10月11日公布2020年财政预算案时，会公布2020年经济增长预测；国行预测2019年取得4.3%至4.8%增长率。
肯纳格研究调高第三季经济增长预测（由4.2%上修至4.4%），惟第四季从4.7%调低至4.0%，而维持全年经济增长4.5%预测。
下半年通膨压力料升温
安联星展研究维持全年经济增长4.5%预测，并可能有上行空间。
下半年通膨压力料高于首半年，全年通膨率0.8%。
私人消费形成次季首要经济动力（占总国内生产总值的58.3%），次季按年增长7.8%。固定资本形成总额（FOMC）最近几季增长率走低，安联预期未来数据私人消费将支援增长率上继续扮演要角。

topglove,"Thu, 8 Aug 2019, 9:36 AM","Top Glove Corporation - Uptick In Nitrile Demand, But Competitive Pressure In Latex Gloves - Kenanga Research & Investment | I3investor",https://klse.i3investor.com/blogs/kenangaresearch/2019-08-08-story218624-Top_Glove_Corporation_Uptick_In_Nitrile_Demand_But_Competitive_Pressure_In_Latex_Gloves.jsp,"We are neutral on TOPGLOV’s prospects. Although we are positive on growth in subsequent quarters underpinned by uptick in nitrile demand driven by re-stocking activities, the group is plagued with competitive pressure from low margins latex gloves. We cut our FY19E/FY20E net profit by 4% each. Our TP is cut from RM4.70 to RM4.50 based on 25.5x FY20E revised EPS. Reiterate MP.
Uptick in nitrile demand and longer delivery lead times. We understand that the robust demand for nitrile has led to longer delivery lead times (the time taken between order and delivery) which has risen to between 45 to 50 days as compared to 30 to 40 days. Due to the easing cost of input latex raw material, we expect margins recovery in 4Q19. However, looking ahead, the keen competition in the latex segment could negatively impact latex gloves margin.
ASP hike to mitigate the effect of higher costs. Due to the lag effect in passing cost through as a result of higher natural gas and raw material (latex), we expect Top Glove to raise ASPs in an effort to contain high operating costs and put brakes on further margin compression in subsequent quarters. Note that 3Q19’s sharp PBT margin erosion (-3.9% pts QoQ; -5.3% pts YoY) was due to price competition and delays in cost pass-through for natural gas and latex. Recall, while pricing adjustments were made subsequently, there was a time lag of two months before the cost increase could be passed on to customers. Furthermore, we gather that nitrile glove competition has subsided on the back of delayed incoming capacities, which could ease downwards pressure on ASPs.
Slow recovery in Aspion. Generally, Aspion is improving but we expect flattish FY19 as the unit is unable to take full advantage of the strong surgical demand. All in, we still see low risk of Aspion’s related impairments.
Leveraging on technology to reduce cost. In an effort to mitigate rising cost and reduce reliance on labour, TOPGLOV is embarking on more automation in the production processes including: (i) an artificial intelligence system to detect and remove defective gloves, (ii) automated warehouse management system, and (iii) automated glove packing system (expected to commence by mid-2019). The total saving is estimated at 5% of our FY20E earnings.
Expansion plans. Top Glove’s capacity expansion includes: Factory 32 (Phases 2 commence production by 4Q 2019 ; 1.2b pieces), Factory 33 (operational by 3Q 2019; 1.2b pieces), Factory 2B (operational by 4Q19; 0.8b pieces), Factory 5A (operational by 1Q 2020; 2b pieces), Factory F40 (Phase 1 operational by 1Q 2020 and Phase 2 operational by 3Q 2020; 3.8b pieces), Factory F41 (operational 2Q 2020; 4b pieces) Factory F42 (operational by 4Q 2020 delayed from 3Q 2020; 4.8b pieces), and Factory 8A (operational by 4Q 2020 delayed from early 2020; 2.8b pieces) which will boost the group’s total production capacity by 20.6b gloves per annum to 83.3b (+33%).
Downgrade our FY19E/FY20E net profit by 4% each to take into account lower margins in the latex segment.
Maintain MP. Correspondingly, our TP is cut from RM4.70 to RM4.50 based on 25.5x FY20E revised EPS (at +1.0SD above 5-year historical forward mean). Although we are positive about its growth in subsequent quarters ahead underpinned by uptick in nitrile demand, the group is plagued with competitive pressure from low margins latex gloves and a slow recovery at Aspion.
A key risk to our call is lower-than-expected sales volume and ASPs.
